# Deployment

To build the static files of your website for production, run:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run build
```

Once it finishes, the static files will be generated within the `build` directory.

:::note

The only responsibility of Docusaurus is to build your site and emit static files in `build`.

It is now up to you to choose how to host those static files.

:::

You can deploy your site to static site hosting services such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Render](https://render.com/docs/static-sites), and [Surge](https://surge.sh/help/getting-started-with-surge).

A Docusaurus site is statically rendered, and it can generally work without JavaScript!

## Configuration {#configuration}

The following parameters are required in `docusaurus.config.js` to optimize routing and serve files from the correct location:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `url` | URL for your site. For a site deployed at `https://my-org.com/my-project/`, `url` is `https://my-org.com/`. |
| `baseUrl` | Base URL for your project, with a trailing slash. For a site deployed at `https://my-org.com/my-project/`, `baseUrl` is `/my-project/`. |

## Testing your Build Locally {#testing-build-locally}

It is important to test your build locally before deploying it for production. Docusaurus provides a [`docusaurus serve`](cli.mdx#docusaurus-serve-sitedir) command for that:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run serve
```

By default, this will load your site at [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/).

## Trailing slash configuration {#trailing-slashes}

Docusaurus has a [`trailingSlash` config](./api/docusaurus.config.js.mdx#trailingSlash) to allow customizing URLs/links and emitted filename patterns.

The default value generally works fine. Unfortunately, each static hosting provider has a **different behavior**, and deploying the exact same site to various hosts can lead to distinct results. Depending on your host, it can be useful to change this config.

:::tip

Use [slorber/trailing-slash-guide](https://github.com/slorber/trailing-slash-guide) to understand better the behavior of your host and configure `trailingSlash` appropriately.

:::

## Using environment variables {#using-environment-variables}

Putting potentially sensitive information in the environment is common practice. However, in a typical Docusaurus website, the `docusaurus.config.js` file is the only interface to the Node.js environment (see [our architecture overview](advanced/architecture.mdx)), while everything else (MDX pages, React components, etc.) are client side and do not have direct access to the `process` global variable. In this case, you can consider using [`customFields`](api/docusaurus.config.js.mdx#customFields) to pass environment variables to the client side.

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
// If you are using dotenv (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
import 'dotenv/config';

export default {
  title: '...',
  url: process.env.URL, // You can use environment variables to control site specifics as well
  // highlight-start
  customFields: {
    // Put your custom environment here
    teamEmail: process.env.EMAIL,
  },
  // highlight-end
};
```

```jsx title="home.jsx"
import useDocusaurusContext from '@docusaurus/useDocusaurusContext';

export default function Home() {
  const {
    siteConfig: {customFields},
  } = useDocusaurusContext();
  return <div>Contact us through {customFields.teamEmail}!</div>;
}
```

## Choosing a hosting provider {#choosing-a-hosting-provider}

There are a few common hosting options:

- [Self hosting](#self-hosting) with an HTTP server like Apache2 or Nginx.
- Jamstack providers (e.g. [Netlify](#deploying-to-netlify) and [Vercel](#deploying-to-vercel)). We will use them as references, but the same reasoning can apply to other providers.
- [GitHub Pages](#deploying-to-github-pages) (by definition, it is also Jamstack, but we compare it separately).

If you are unsure of which one to choose, ask the following questions:

<details>

<summary>
  How many resources (money, person-hours, etc.) am I willing to invest in this?
</summary>

- 🔴 Self-hosting requires experience in networking as well as Linux and web server administration. It's the most difficult option, and would require the most time to manage successfully. Expense-wise, cloud services are almost never free, and purchasing/deploying an onsite server can be even more costly.
- 🟢 Jamstack providers can help you set up a working website in almost no time and offer features like server-side redirects that are easily configurable. Many providers offer generous build-time quotas even for free plans that you would almost never exceed. However, free plans have limits, and you would need to pay once you hit those limits. Check the pricing page of your provider for details.
- 🟡 The GitHub Pages deployment workflow can be tedious to set up. (Evidence: see the length of [Deploying to GitHub Pages](#deploying-to-github-pages)!) However, this service (including build and deployment) is always free for public repositories, and we have detailed instructions to help you make it work.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How much server-side customization do I need?</summary>

- 🟢 With self-hosting, you have access to the entire server's configuration. You can configure the virtual host to serve different content based on the request URL, you can do complicated server-side redirects, you can implement authentication, and so on. If you need a lot of server-side features, self-host your website.
- 🟡 Jamstack usually offers some server-side configuration (e.g. URL formatting (trailing slashes), server-side redirects, etc.).
- 🔴 GitHub Pages doesn't expose server-side configuration besides enforcing HTTPS and setting CNAME records.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do I need collaboration-friendly deployment workflows?</summary>

- 🟡 Self-hosted services can leverage continuous deployment functionality like Netlify, but more heavy-lifting is involved. Usually, you would designate a specific person to manage the deployment, and the workflow wouldn't be very git-based as opposed to the other two options.
- 🟢 Netlify and Vercel have deploy previews for every pull request, which is useful for a team to review work before merging to production. You can also manage a team with different member access to the deployment.
- 🟡 GitHub Pages cannot do deploy previews in a non-convoluted way. One repo can only be associated with one site deployment. On the other hand, you can control who has write access to the site's deployment.

</details>

There isn't a silver bullet. You need to weigh your needs and resources before making a choice.

## Self-Hosting {#self-hosting}

Docusaurus can be self-hosted using [`docusaurus serve`](cli.mdx#docusaurus-serve-sitedir). Change port using `--port` and `--host` to change host.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run serve -- --build --port 80 --host 0.0.0.0
```

:::warning

It is not the best option, compared to a static hosting provider / CDN.

:::

:::warning

In the following sections, we will introduce a few common hosting providers and how they should be configured to deploy Docusaurus sites most efficiently. Docusaurus is not affiliated with any of these services, and this information is provided for convenience only. Some of the write-ups are provided by third-parties, and recent API changes may not be reflected on our side. If you see outdated content, PRs are welcome.

Because we can only provide this content on a best-effort basis only, we have stopped accepting PRs adding new hosting options. You can, however, publish your writeup on a separate site (e.g. your blog, or the provider's official website), and ask us to include a link to your writeup.

:::

## Deploying to Netlify {#deploying-to-netlify}

To deploy your Docusaurus sites to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), first make sure the following options are properly configured:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
export default {
  // highlight-start
  url: 'https://docusaurus-2.netlify.app', // Url to your site with no trailing slash
  baseUrl: '/', // Base directory of your site relative to your repo
  // highlight-end
  // ...
};
```

Then, [create your site with Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start).

While you set up the site, specify the build commands and directories as follows:

- build command: `npm run build`
- publish directory: `build`

If you did not configure these build options, you may still go to "Site settings" -> "Build & deploy" after your site is created.

Once properly configured with the above options, your site should deploy and automatically redeploy upon merging to your deploy branch, which defaults to `main`.

:::warning

Some Docusaurus sites put the `docs` folder outside of `website` (most likely former Docusaurus v1 sites):

```bash
repo           # git root
├── docs       # MD files
└── website    # Docusaurus root
```

If you decide to use the `website` folder as Netlify's base directory, Netlify will not trigger builds when you update the `docs` folder, and you need to configure a [custom `ignore` command](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/common-configurations/ignore-builds/):

```toml title="website/netlify.toml"
[build]
  ignore = "git diff --quiet $CACHED_COMMIT_REF $COMMIT_REF . ../docs/"
```

:::

:::warning

By default, Netlify adds trailing slashes to Docusaurus URLs.

It is recommended to disable the Netlify setting `Post Processing > Asset Optimization > Pretty Urls` to prevent lowercase URLs, unnecessary redirects, and 404 errors.

**Be very careful**: the `Disable asset optimization` global checkbox is broken and does not really disable the `Pretty URLs` setting in practice. Please make sure to **uncheck it independently**.

If you want to keep the `Pretty Urls` Netlify setting on, adjust the `trailingSlash` Docusaurus config appropriately.

Refer to [slorber/trailing-slash-guide](https://github.com/slorber/trailing-slash-guide) for more information.

:::

## Deploying to Vercel {#deploying-to-vercel}

Deploying your Docusaurus project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) will provide you with [various benefits](https://vercel.com/) in the areas of performance and ease of use.

To deploy your Docusaurus project with a [Vercel for Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git), make sure it has been pushed to a Git repository.

Import the project into Vercel using the [Import Flow](https://vercel.com/import/git). During the import, you will find all relevant options preconfigured for you; however, you can choose to change any of these [options](https://vercel.com/docs/build-step#build-&-development-settings).

After your project has been imported, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments#preview), and all changes made to the [Production Branch](https://vercel.com/docs/git-integrations#production-branch) (usually "main" or "master") will result in a [Production Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments#production).

## Deploying to GitHub Pages {#deploying-to-github-pages}

Docusaurus provides an easy way to publish to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which comes free with every GitHub repository.

### Overview {#github-pages-overview}

Usually, there are two repositories (at least two branches) involved in a publishing process: the branch containing the source files, and the branch containing the build output to be served with GitHub Pages. In the following tutorial, they will be referred to as **"source"** and **"deployment"**, respectively.

Each GitHub repository is associated with a GitHub Pages service. If the deployment repository is called `my-org/my-project` (where `my-org` is the organization name or username), the deployed site will appear at `https://my-org.github.io/my-project/`. If the deployment repository is called `my-org/my-org.github.io` (the _organization GitHub Pages repo_), the site will appear at `https://my-org.github.io/`.

:::info

In case you want to use your custom domain for GitHub Pages, create a `CNAME` file in the `static` directory. Anything within the `static` directory will be copied to the root of the `build` directory for deployment. When using a custom domain, you should be able to move back from `baseUrl: '/projectName/'` to `baseUrl: '/'`, and also set your `url` to your custom domain.

You may refer to GitHub Pages' documentation [User, Organization, and Project Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages) for more details.

:::

GitHub Pages picks up deploy-ready files (the output from `docusaurus build`) from the default branch (`master` / `main`, usually) or the `gh-pages` branch, and either from the root or the `/docs` folder. You can configure that through `Settings > Pages` in your repository. This branch will be called the "deployment branch".

We provide a `docusaurus deploy` command that helps you deploy your site from the source branch to the deployment branch in one command: clone, build, and commit.

### `docusaurus.config.js` settings {#docusaurusconfigjs-settings}

First, modify your `docusaurus.config.js` and add the following params:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `organizationName` | The GitHub user or organization that owns the deployment repository. |
| `projectName` | The name of the deployment repository. |
| `deploymentBranch` | The name of the deployment branch. It defaults to `'gh-pages'` for non-organization GitHub Pages repos (`projectName` not ending in `.github.io`). Otherwise, it needs to be explicit as a config field or environment variable. |

These fields also have their environment variable counterparts which have a higher priority: `ORGANIZATION_NAME`, `PROJECT_NAME`, and `DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH`.

:::warning

GitHub Pages adds a trailing slash to Docusaurus URLs by default. It is recommended to set a `trailingSlash` config (`true` or `false`, not `undefined`).

:::

Example:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
export default {
  // ...
  url: 'https://endiliey.github.io', // Your website URL
  baseUrl: '/',
  // highlight-start
  projectName: 'endiliey.github.io',
  organizationName: 'endiliey',
  trailingSlash: false,
  // highlight-end
  // ...
};
```

:::warning

By default, GitHub Pages runs published files through [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Since Jekyll will discard any files that begin with `_`, it is recommended that you disable Jekyll by adding an empty file named `.nojekyll` file to your `static` directory.

:::

### Environment settings {#environment-settings}

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `USE_SSH` | Set to `true` to use SSH instead of the default HTTPS for the connection to the GitHub repo. If the source repo URL is an SSH URL (e.g. `git@github.com:facebook/docusaurus.git`), `USE_SSH` is inferred to be `true`. |
| `GIT_USER` | The username for a GitHub account that **has push access to the deployment repo**. For your own repositories, this will usually be your GitHub username. Required if not using SSH, and ignored otherwise. |
| `GIT_PASS` | Personal access token of the git user (specified by `GIT_USER`), to facilitate non-interactive deployment (e.g. continuous deployment) |
| `CURRENT_BRANCH` | The source branch. Usually, the branch will be `main` or `master`, but it could be any branch except for `gh-pages`. If nothing is set for this variable, then the current branch from which `docusaurus deploy` is invoked will be used. |
| `GIT_USER_NAME` | The `git config user.name` value to use when pushing to the deployment repo |
| `GIT_USER_EMAIL` | The `git config user.email` value to use when pushing to the deployment repo |

GitHub enterprise installations should work in the same manner as github.com; you only need to set the organization's GitHub Enterprise host as an environment variable:

| Name          | Description                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `GITHUB_HOST` | The domain name of your GitHub enterprise site. |
| `GITHUB_PORT` | The port of your GitHub enterprise site.        |

### Deploy {#deploy}

Finally, to deploy your site to GitHub Pages, run:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">
```

```bash
GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME> yarn deploy
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
```

```batch
cmd /C "set "GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME>" && yarn deploy"
```

```mdx-code-block

<TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell">
```

```powershell
cmd /C 'set "GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME>" && yarn deploy'
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

:::warning

Beginning in August 2021, GitHub requires every command-line sign-in to use the **personal access token** instead of the password. When GitHub prompts for your password, enter the PAT instead. See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for more information.

Alternatively, you can use SSH (`USE_SSH=true`) to log in.

:::

### Triggering deployment with GitHub Actions {#triggering-deployment-with-github-actions}

[GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) allow you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository.

The workflow examples below assume your website source resides in the `main` branch of your repository (the _source branch_ is `main`), and your [publishing source](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) is configured for [publishing with a custom GitHub Actions Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow).

Our goal is that:

1. When a new pull request is made to `main`, there's an action that ensures the site builds successfully, without actually deploying. This job will be called `test-deploy`.
2. When a pull request is merged to the `main` branch or someone pushes to the `main` branch directly, it will be built and deployed to GitHub Pages. This job will be called `deploy`.

Here are two approaches to deploying your docs with GitHub Actions. Based on the location of your deployment repository, choose the relevant tab below:

- Source repo and deployment repo are the **same** repository.
- The deployment repo is a **remote** repository, different from the source. Instructions for this scenario assume [publishing source](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) is the `gh-pages` branch.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="same" label="Same">
```

While you can have both jobs defined in the same workflow file, the original `deploy` workflow will always be listed as skipped in the PR check suite status, which is not indicative of the actual status and provides no value to the review process. We therefore propose to manage them as separate workflows instead.

<details>
<summary>GitHub action files</summary>

Add these two workflow files:

:::warning Tweak the parameters for your setup

If your Docusaurus project is not at the root of your repo, you may need to configure a [default working directory](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-set-the-default-shell-and-working-directory), and adjust the paths accordingly.

A cross-repo publish is more difficult to set up because you need to push to another repo with permission checks. We will be using SSH to do the authentication.

1. Generate a new [SSH key](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent). Since this SSH key will be used in CI, make sure to not enter any passphrase.
2. By default, your public key should have been created in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`; otherwise, use the name you've provided in the previous step to add your key to [GitHub deploy keys](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/).
3. Copy the key to clipboard with `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and paste it as a [deploy key](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) in the deployment repository. Copy the file content if the command line doesn't work for you. Check the box for `Allow write access` before saving your deployment key.
4. You'll need your private key as a [GitHub secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) to allow Docusaurus to run the deployment for you.
5. Copy your private key with `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa` and paste a GitHub secret with the name `GH_PAGES_DEPLOY` on your source repository. Copy the file content if the command line doesn't work for you. Save your secret.
6. Create your [documentation workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/creating-an-example-workflow) in the `.github/workflows/` directory. In this example it's the `deploy.yml` file.

At this point, you should have:

- the source repo with the GitHub workflow set with the private SSH key as the GitHub Secret, and
- your deployment repo set with the public SSH key in GitHub Deploy Keys.

<summary>Site not deployed properly?</summary>

After pushing to main, if you don't see your site published at the desired location (for example, it says "There isn't a GitHub Pages site here", or it's showing your repo's README.md file), try the following:

- Wait about three minutes and refresh. It may take a few minutes for GitHub pages to pick up the new files.
- Check your repo's landing page for a little green tick next to the last commit's title, indicating the CI has passed. If you see a cross, it means the build or deployment failed, and you should check the log for more debugging information.
- Click on the tick and make sure you see a "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow. Names like "pages build and deployment / deploy" are GitHub's default workflows, indicating your custom deployment workflow failed to be triggered at all. Make sure the YAML files are placed under the `.github/workflows` folder, and that the trigger condition is set correctly (e.g., if your default branch is "master" instead of "main", you need to change the `on.push` property).
- Under your repo's Settings > Pages, make sure the "Source" (which is the source for the _deployment_ files, not "source" as in our terminology) is set to "gh-pages" + "/ (root)", since we are using `gh-pages` as the deployment branch.

If you are using a custom domain:

- Verify that you have the correct DNS records set up if you're using a custom domain. See [GitHub pages documentation on configuring custom domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages). Also, please be aware that it may take up to 24 hours for DNS changes to propagate through the internet.

### Triggering deployment with Travis CI {#triggering-deployment-with-travis-ci}

Continuous integration (CI) services are typically used to perform routine tasks whenever new commits are checked in to source control. These tasks can be any combination of running unit tests and integration tests, automating builds, publishing packages to npm, and deploying changes to your website. All you need to do to automate the deployment of your website is to invoke the `yarn deploy` script whenever your website is updated. The following section covers how to do just that using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/), a popular continuous integration service provider.

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and generate a new [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/). When creating the token, grant it the `repo` scope so that it has the permissions it needs.
2. Using your GitHub account, [add the Travis CI app](https://github.com/marketplace/travis-ci) to the repository you want to activate.
3. Open your Travis CI dashboard. The URL looks like `https://travis-ci.com/USERNAME/REPO`, and navigate to the `More options > Setting > Environment Variables` section of your repository.
4. Create a new environment variable named `GH_TOKEN` with your newly generated token as its value, then `GH_EMAIL` (your email address) and `GH_NAME` (your GitHub username).
5. Create a `.travis.yml` on the root of your repository with the following:

```yml title=".travis.yml"
language: node_js
node_js:
  - 18
branches:
  only:
    - main
cache:
  yarn: true
script:
  - git config --global user.name "${GH_NAME}"
  - git config --global user.email "${GH_EMAIL}"
  - echo "machine github.com login ${GH_NAME} password ${GH_TOKEN}" > ~/.netrc
  - yarn install
  - GIT_USER="${GH_NAME}" yarn deploy
```

Now, whenever a new commit lands in `main`, Travis CI will run your suite of tests and if everything passes, your website will be deployed via the `yarn deploy` script.

### Triggering deployment with Buddy {#triggering-deployment-with-buddy}

[Buddy](https://buddy.works/) is an easy-to-use CI/CD tool that allows you to automate the deployment of your portal to different environments, including GitHub Pages.

Follow these steps to create a pipeline that automatically deploys a new version of your website whenever you push changes to the selected branch of your project:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and generate a new [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/). When creating the token, grant it the `repo` scope so that it has the permissions it needs.
2. Sign in to your Buddy account and create a new project.
3. Choose GitHub as your git hosting provider and select the repository with the code of your website.
4. Using the left navigation panel, switch to the `Pipelines` view.
5. Create a new pipeline. Define its name, set the trigger mode to `On push`, and select the branch that triggers the pipeline execution.
6. Add a `Node.js` action.
7. Add these commands in the action's terminal:

```bash
GIT_USER=<GH_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
git config --global user.email "<YOUR_GH_EMAIL>"
git config --global user.name "<YOUR_GH_USERNAME>"
yarn deploy
```

After creating this simple pipeline, each new commit pushed to the branch you selected deploys your website to GitHub Pages using `yarn deploy`. Read [this guide](https://buddy.works/guides/react-docusaurus) to learn more about setting up a CI/CD pipeline for Docusaurus.

### Using Azure Pipelines {#using-azure-pipelines}

1. Sign Up at [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/) if you haven't already.
2. Create an organization. Within the organization, create a project and connect your repository from GitHub.
3. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and generate a new [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) with the `repo` scope.
4. In the project page (which looks like `https://dev.azure.com/ORG_NAME/REPO_NAME/_build`), create a new pipeline with the following text. Also, click on edit and add a new environment variable named `GH_TOKEN` with your newly generated token as its value, then `GH_EMAIL` (your email address) and `GH_NAME` (your GitHub username). Make sure to mark them as secret. Alternatively, you can also add a file named `azure-pipelines.yml` at your repository root.

```yml title="azure-pipelines.yml"
trigger:
  - main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
  - checkout: self
    persistCredentials: true

  - task: NodeTool@0
    inputs:
      versionSpec: '18'
    displayName: Install Node.js

  - script: |
      git config --global user.name "${GH_NAME}"
      git config --global user.email "${GH_EMAIL}"
      git checkout -b main
      echo "machine github.com login ${GH_NAME} password ${GH_TOKEN}" > ~/.netrc
      yarn install
      GIT_USER="${GH_NAME}" yarn deploy
    env:
      GH_NAME: $(GH_NAME)
      GH_EMAIL: $(GH_EMAIL)
      GH_TOKEN: $(GH_TOKEN)
    displayName: Install and build
```

### Using Drone {#using-drone}

1. Create a new SSH key that will be the [deploy key](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys) for your project.
2. Name your private and public keys to be specific and so that it does not overwrite your other [SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
3. Go to `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/settings/keys` and add a new deploy key by pasting in the public key you just generated.
4. Open your Drone.io dashboard and log in. The URL looks like `https://cloud.drone.io/USERNAME/REPO`.
5. Click on the repository, click on activate repository, and add a secret called `git_deploy_private_key` with your private key value that you just generated.
6. Create a `.drone.yml` on the root of your repository with the below text.

```yml title=".drone.yml"
kind: pipeline
type: docker
trigger:
  event:
    - tag
- name: Website
  image: node
  commands:
    - mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
    - ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com >> $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts
    - echo "$GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY" > "$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa"
    - chmod 0600 $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
    - cd website
    - yarn install
    - yarn deploy
  environment:
    USE_SSH: true
    GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY:
      from_secret: git_deploy_private_key
```

Now, whenever you push a new tag to GitHub, this trigger will start the drone CI job to publish your website.

   ```
3. Then, run this command inside the root directory of your project:
   ```bash
   surge build/
   ```

First-time users of Surge would be prompted to create an account from the command line (which happens only once).

Confirm that the site you want to publish is in the `build` directory. A randomly generated subdomain `*.surge.sh subdomain` is always given (which can be edited).

### Using your domain {#using-your-domain}

If you have a domain name you can deploy your site using the command:

```bash
surge build/ your-domain.com
```

Your site is now deployed for free at `subdomain.surge.sh` or `your-domain.com` depending on the method you chose.

### Setting up CNAME file {#setting-up-cname-file}

Store your domain in a CNAME file for future deployments with the following command:

```bash
echo subdomain.surge.sh > CNAME
```

You can deploy any other changes in the future with the command `surge`.
