# ðŸ“¦ create-docusaurus

A scaffolding utility to help you instantly set up a functional Docusaurus app.

## Usage {#usage}

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest [name] [template] [rootDir]
```

The `name` argument will be used as the site's path as well as the `name` field in the created app's package.json. It can be an absolute path, or a path relative to `rootDir`.

The `template` argument can be one of the following:

- `classic`: Uses the classic template (recommended)
- `facebook`: Uses the Facebook/Meta template, which contains some Meta-specific setup
- A git repo URL (beginning with `https://` or `git@`), which can be cloned to the destination
- A local file path relative to CWD, which contains the files to be copied to destination

The `rootDir` will be used to resolve the absolute path to the site directory. The default is CWD.

:::warning

This command should be preferably used in an interactive shell so all features are available.

## Options {#options}

### `-t, --typescript` {#typescript}

Used when the template argument is a recognized name. Currently, only `classic` provides a TypeScript variant.

### `-g, --git-strategy` {#git-strategy}

Used when the template argument is a git repo. It needs to be one of:

- `deep`: preserves full git history
- `shallow`: clones with `--depth=1`
- `copy`: does a shallow clone, but does not create a git repo
- `custom`: enter your custom git clone command. We will prompt you for it. You can write something like `git clone --depth 10`, and we will append the repository URL and destination directory.

### `-p, --package-manager` {#package-manager}

Value should be one of `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`. If it's not explicitly provided, Docusaurus will infer one based on:

- The lockfile already present in the CWD (e.g. if you are setting up website in an existing project)
- The command used to invoke `create-docusaurus` (e.g. `npm init`, `npx`, `yarn create`, `bunx`, etc.)
- Interactive prompting, in case all heuristics are not present

### `-s, --skip-install` {#skip-install}

If provided, Docusaurus will not automatically install dependencies after creating the app. The `--package-manager` option is only useful when you are actually installing dependencies.
