In addition to the basic Markdown syntax, we use [remark-admonitions](https://github.com/elviswolcott/remark-admonitions) alongside MDX to add support for admonitions. Admonitions are wrapped by a set of 3 colons.

Example:

    :::note

    The content and title *can* include markdown.

    :::

    :::tip You can specify an optional title

    Heads up! Here's a pro-tip.

    :::

    :::info

    Useful information.

    :::

    :::caution

    Warning! You better pay attention!

    :::

    :::danger

    Danger danger, mayday!

:::note

The content and title _can_ include markdown.
