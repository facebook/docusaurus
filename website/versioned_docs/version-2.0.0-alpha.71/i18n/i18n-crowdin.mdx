The i18n system of Docusaurus is **decoupled from any translation software**.

You can integrate Docusaurus with the **tools and SaaS of your choice**, as long as you put the **translation files at the correct location**.

We document the usage of [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/), as **one** possible **integration example**.

:::caution

This is **not an endorsement of Crowdin** as the unique choice to translate a Docusaurus site, but it is successfully used by Facebook to translate documentation projects such as [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/).

Refer to the **[Crowdin documentation](https://support.crowdin.com/)** and **[Crowdin support](mailto:support@crowdin.com)** for help.

## Crowdin overview {#crowdin-overview}

Crowdin is a translation SaaS, offering a [free plan for open-source projects](https://crowdin.com/page/open-source-project-setup-request).

We recommend the following translation workflow:

- **Upload sources** to Crowdin (untranslated files)
- Use Crowdin to **translate the content**
- **Download translations** from Crowdin (localized translation files)

Crowdin provides a [CLI](https://support.crowdin.com/cli-tool/) to **upload sources** and **download translations**, allowing you to automate the translation process.

The [`crowdin.yml` configuration file](https://support.crowdin.com/configuration-file/) is convenient for Docusaurus, and permits to **download the localized translation files at the expected location** (in `i18n/<locale>/..`).

Read the **[official documentation](https://support.crowdin.com/)** to know more about advanced features and different translation workflows.

## Crowdin tutorial {#crowdin-tutorial}

This is a walk-through of using Crowdin to translate a newly initialized English Docusaurus website into French, and assume you already followed the [i18n tutorial](./i18n-tutorial.md).

The end result can be seen at [docusaurus-crowdin-example.netlify.app](https://docusaurus-crowdin-example.netlify.app/) ([repository](https://github.com/slorber/docusaurus-crowdin-example)).

### Prepare the Docusaurus site {#prepare-the-docusaurus-site}

Initialize a new Docusaurus site:

```bash
npx @docusaurus/init@latest init website classic
```

Add the site configuration for the French language:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  i18n: {
    defaultLocale: 'en',
    locales: ['en', 'fr'],
  },
  themeConfig: {
    navbar: {
      items: [
        // ...
        {
          type: 'localeDropdown',
          position: 'left',
        },
        // ...
      ],
    },
  },
  // ...
};
```

Translate the homepage:

```jsx title="src/pages/index.js"
import React from 'react';
import Translate from '@docusaurus/Translate';
import Layout from '@theme/Layout';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1 style={{margin: 20}}>
        <Translate description="The homepage main heading">
          Welcome to my Docusaurus translated site!
        </Translate>
      </h1>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

### Create a Crowdin project {#create-a-crowdin-project}

Sign up on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/), and create a project.

Use English as source language, and French as target language.

![Create a Crowdin project with english as source language, and french as target language](/img/crowdin/crowdin-create-project.png)

Your project is created, but it is empty for now. We will upload the files to translate in the next steps.

### Create the Crowdin configuration {#create-the-crowdin-configuration}

This configuration ([doc](https://support.crowdin.com/configuration-file/)) provides a mapping for the Crowdin CLI to understand:

- Where to find the source files to upload (JSON and Markdown)
- Where to download the files after translation (in `i18n/<locale>`)

Create `crowdin.yml` in `website`:

```yml title="crowdin.yml"
project_id: '123456'
api_token_env: 'CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN'
preserve_hierarchy: true
files: [
    # JSON translation files
    {
      source: '/i18n/en/**/*',
      translation: '/i18n/%two_letters_code%/**/%original_file_name%',
    },
    # Docs Markdown files
    {
      source: '/docs/**/*',
      translation: '/i18n/%two_letters_code%/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/**/%original_file_name%',
    },
    # Blog Markdown files
    {
      source: '/blog/**/*',
      translation: '/i18n/%two_letters_code%/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/**/%original_file_name%',
    },
  ]
```

Crowdin has its own syntax for declaring source/translation paths:

- `**/*`: everything in a subfolder
- `%two_letters_code%`: the 2-letters variant of Crowdin target languages (`fr` in our case)
- `**/%original_file_name%`: the translations will preserve the original folder/file hierarchy

:::info

The Crowdin CLI warnings are not always easy to understand.

We advise to:

- change one thing at a time
- re-upload sources after any configuration change
- use paths starting with `/` (`./` does not work)
- avoid fancy globbing patterns like `/docs/**/*.(md|mdx)` (does not work)

:::

#### Access token {#access-token}

The `api_token_env` attribute defines the **env variable name** read by the Crowdin CLI.

You can obtain a `Personal Access Token` on [your personal profile page](https://crowdin.com/settings#api-key).

:::tip

You can keep the default value `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN`, and set this environment variable and on your computer and on the CI server to the generated access token.

:::

:::caution

A Personal Access Tokens grant **read-write access to all your Crowdin projects**.

You should **not commit** it, and it may be a good idea to create a dedicated **Crowdin profile for your company** instead of using a personal account.

:::

#### Other configuration fields {#other-configuration-fields}

- `project_id`: can be hardcoded, and is found on `https://crowdin.com/project/<MY_PROJECT_NAME>/settings#api`
- `preserve_hierarchy`: preserve the folder's hierarchy of your docs on Crowdin UI instead of flattening everything

### Install the Crowdin CLI {#install-the-crowdin-cli}

This tutorial use the CLI in version `3.5.2`, but we expect `3.x` releases to keep working.

Install the Crowdin CLI as a NPM package to your Docusaurus site:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @crowdin/cli@3
```

Add a `crowdin` script:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "crowdin": "crowdin"
  }
}
```

Test that you can run the Crowdin CLI:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run crowdin -- --version
```

Set the `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN` env variable on your computer, to allow the CLI to authenticate with the Crowdin API.

:::tip

Temporarily, you can hardcode your personal token in `crowdin.yml` with `api_token: 'MY-TOKEN'`.

:::

### Upload the sources {#upload-the-sources}

Generate the JSON translation files for the default language in `website/i18n/en`:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run write-translations
```

Upload all the JSON and Markdown translation files:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run crowdin upload
```

![Crowdin CLI uploading Docusaurus source files](/img/crowdin/crowdin-upload-sources-cli.png)

Your source files are now visible on the Crowdin interface: `https://crowdin.com/project/<MY_PROJECT_NAME>/settings#files`

![Crowdin UI showing Docusaurus source files](/img/crowdin/crowdin-source-files.png)

### Translate the sources {#translate-the-sources}

On `https://crowdin.com/project/<MY_PROJECT_NAME>`, click on the French target language.

![Crowdin UI showing French translation files](/img/crowdin/crowdin-french-translations.png)

Translate some Markdown files.

![Crowdin UI to translate a Markdown file](/img/crowdin/crowdin-translate-markdown.png)

:::tip

Use `Hide String` to make sure translators **don't translate things that should not be**:

- Frontmatter: `id`, `slug`, `tags` ...
- Admonitions: `:::`, `:::note`, `:::tip` ...

![Crowdin UI hide string](/img/crowdin/crowdin-hide-string.png)

:::

Translate some JSON files.

![Crowdin UI to translate a JSON file](/img/crowdin/crowdin-translate-json.png)

:::info

The `description` attribute of JSON translation files is visible on Crowdin to help translate the strings.

:::

:::tip

**[Pre-translate](https://support.crowdin.com/pre-translation-via-machine/)** your site, and **fix pre-translation mistakes manually** (enable the Global Translation Memory in settings first).

Use the `Hide String` feature first, as Crowdin is pre-translating things too optimistically.

:::

### Download the translations {#download-the-translations}

Use the Crowdin CLI to download the translated JSON and Markdown files.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run crowdin download
```

The translated content should be downloaded in `i18n/fr`.

Start your site on the French locale:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run start -- --locale fr
```

Make sure that your website is now translated in French at `http://localhost:3000/fr/`.

### Automate with CI {#automate-with-ci}

We will configure the CI to **download the Crowdin translations at build time**, and keep them outside of Git.

Add `website/i18n` to `.gitignore`.

Set the `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN` env variable on your CI.

Create a npm script to `sync` Crowdin (extract sources, upload sources, download translations):

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "crowdin:sync": "docusaurus write-translations && crowdin upload && crowdin download"
  }
}
```

Call the `npm run crowdin:sync` script in your CI, just before building the Docusaurus site.

:::tip

Keep your deploy-previews fast: don't download translations, and use `npm run build -- --locale en` for feature branches.

:::

:::caution

Crowdin does not support well multiple concurrent uploads/downloads: it is preferable to only include translations to your production deployment, and keep deploy previews untranslated.

:::

## Advanced Crowdin topics {#advanced-crowdin-topics}

### MDX {#mdx}

:::caution

Pay special attention to the JSX fragments in MDX documents!

:::

Crowdin **does not support officially MDX**, but they added **support for the `.mdx` extension**, and interpret such files as Markdown (instead of plain text).

#### MDX problems {#mdx-problems}

Crowdin thinks the JSX syntax is embedded HTML, and can mess-up with the JSX markup when you download the translations, leading to a site that fails to build due to invalid JSX.

Simple JSX fragments using simple string props like `<Username name="Sebastien"/>` will work fine.

More complex JSX fragments using object/array props like `<User person={{name: "Sebastien"}}/>` are more likely to fail due to a syntax that does not look like HTML.

#### MDX solutions {#mdx-solutions}

We recommend moving the complex embedded JSX code as separate standalone components.

We also added a `mdx-code-block` escape hatch syntax:

`````text
# How to deploy Docusaurus

To deploy Docusaurus, run the following command:

````mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    { label: 'Bash', value: 'bash' },
    { label: 'Windows', value: 'windows' }
]}>
  <TabItem value="bash">

  ```bash
  GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME> yarn deploy
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows">

  ```batch
  cmd /C "set "GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME>" && yarn deploy"
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````
`````

This will:

- be interpreted by Crowdin as code blocks (and not mess-up with the markup on download)
- be interpreted by Docusaurus as regular JSX (as if it was not wrapped by any code block)
- unfortunately opt-out of MDX tooling (IDE syntax highlighting, Prettier...)

### Docs versioning {#docs-versioning}

Configure translation files for the `website/versioned_docs` folder.

When creating a new version, the source strings will generally be quite similar to the current version (`website/docs`), and you don't want to translate the new version docs again and again.

Crowdin provides a `Duplicate Strings` setting.

![Crowdin Duplicate Strings option setting](/img/crowdin/crowdin-settings-duplicate-strings.png)

We recommend using `Hide`, but the ideal setting depends on how much your versions are different.

:::caution

Not using `Hide` leads to a much larger amount of `source strings` in quotas, and will affect the pricing.

:::

### Multi-instance plugins {#multi-instance-plugins}

You need to configure translation files for each plugin instance.

If you have a docs plugin instance with `id=ios`, you will need to configure those source files as well

- `website/ios`
- `website/ios_versioned_docs` (if versioned)

### Maintaining your site {#maintaining-your-site}

Sometimes, you will **remove or rename a source file** on Git, and Crowdin will display CLI warnings:

![Crowdin CLI: download translation warning](/img/crowdin/crowdin-download-translations-warning.png)

When your sources are refactored, you should use the Crowdin UI to **update your Crowdin files manually**:

![Crowdin UI: renaming a file](/img/crowdin/crowdin-files-rename.png)

### VCS (Git) integrations {#vcs-git-integrations}

Crowdin has multiple VCS integrations for [GitHub](https://support.crowdin.com/github-integration/), GitLab, Bitbucket.

:::warning

We recommend avoiding them.

:::

It could have been helpful to be able to edit the translations in both Git and Crowdin, and have a **bi-directional sync** between the 2 systems.

In practice, **it didn't work very reliably** for a few reasons:

- The Crowdin -> Git sync works fine (with a pull request)
- The Git -> Crowdin sync is manual (you have to press a button)
- The heuristics used by Crowdin to match existing Markdown translations to existing Markdown sources are not 100% reliable, and you have to verify the result on Crowdin UI after any sync from Git
- 2 users concurrently editing on Git and Crowdin can lead to a translation loss
- It requires the `crowdin.yml` file to be at the root of the repository

### In-Context localization {#in-context-localization}

Crowdin has an [In-Context localization](https://support.crowdin.com/in-context-localization/) feature.

:::caution

Unfortunately, it does not work yet for technical reasons, but we have good hope it can be solved.

Crowdin replaces markdown strings with technical ids such as `crowdin:id12345`, but it does so too aggressively, including hidden strings, and mess-up with the frontmatter, admonitions, jsx...

:::

### Localize edit urls {#localize-edit-urls}

When the user is browsing a page at `/fr/doc1`, the edit button will link by default to the unlocalized doc at `website/docs/doc1.md`.

You may prefer the edit button to link to the Crowdin interface instead, and can use the `editUrl` function to customize the edit urls on a per-locale basis.

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
const DefaultLocale = 'en';

module.exports = {
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        docs: {
          // highlight-start
          editUrl: ({locale, versionDocsDirPath, docPath}) => {
            // Link to Crowdin for French docs
            if (locale !== DefaultLocale) {
              return `https://crowdin.com/project/docusaurus-v2/${locale}`;
            }
            // Link to Github for English docs
            return `https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/edit/master/website/${versionDocsDirPath}/${docPath}`;
          },
          // highlight-end
        },
        blog: {
          // highlight-start
          editUrl: ({locale, blogDirPath, blogPath}) => {
            if (locale !== DefaultLocale) {
              return `https://crowdin.com/project/docusaurus-v2/${locale}`;
            }
            return `https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/edit/master/website/${blogDirPath}/${blogPath}`;
          },
          // highlight-start
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

:::note

It is currently **not possible to link to a specific file** in Crowdin.

:::

### Example configuration {#example-configuration}

The **Docusaurus v2 configuration file** is a good example of using versioning and multi-instance:

import CrowdinConfigV2 from '!!raw-loader!@site/../crowdin-v2.yaml';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

<CodeBlock className="language-yaml" title="test">
  {CrowdinConfigV2.split('\n')
    // remove comments
    .map((line) => !line.startsWith('#') && line)
    .filter(Boolean)
    .join('\n')}
</CodeBlock>
