Today, we officially release **[Docusaurus 2 i18n](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/introduction)** ([internationalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization)), as part of [2.0.0-alpha.71](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.71).

Docusaurus 2 has now reached **full feature parity with Docusaurus 1**. 🎉 And soon, after a few additional infrastructure updates and a bit more testing, the **first Docusaurus 2 beta** will be released.

**We went the extra mile**, and the new i18n support is **even better than in Docusaurus 1**.

In this post, we will present you the **translation workflow**, explain some **design decisions** and **showcase early adopter sites** that just went live: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Redwood](https://learn.redwoodjs.com/), and [Datagit](https://datagit.ir/).

We also **dogfood** the i18n support on the **Docusaurus 2 site itself**, and this post is already available in [English](https://docusaurus.io/blog/2021/03/09/releasing-docusaurus-i18n) and [French](https://docusaurus.io/fr/blog/2021/03/09/releasing-docusaurus-i18n)!

## 翻译你的站点

You can translate a Docusaurus site in **3 simple steps**:

1. **Configure**: declare the default locale and alternative locales in `docusaurus.config.js`
2. **Translate**: put the translation files at the [correct filesystem location](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/i18n/introduction#translation-files-location)
3. **Deploy**: build and deploy your site using a single or multi-domain strategy

The i18n support is **very flexible** and based on the **filesystem**.

The **[i18n tutorial](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/tutorial)** is the best way to get started, and we provide help to use **[Git](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/git)** or **[Crowdin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/crowdin)**.

## 设计决策

Docusaurus i18n 系统旨在：

- **Simple**: just put the translated files in the [correct filesystem location](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/i18n/introduction#translation-files-location)
- **Flexible translation workflows**: use Git (monorepo, forks, or submodules), SaaS software, FTP
- **Flexible deployment options**: single, multiple domains, or hybrid
- **Modular**: allow plugin authors to provide i18n support
- **Low-overhead runtime**: documentation is mostly static and does not require a heavy JS library or polyfills
- **Scalable build-times**: allow building and deploying localized sites independently
- **Localize assets**: an image of your site might contain text that should be translated
- **No coupling**: not forced to use any SaaS, yet integrations are possible
- **Easy to use with [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/)**: multiple Docusaurus 1 sites use Crowdin, and should be able to migrate to v2
- **Good SEO defaults**: we set useful SEO headers like [`hreflang`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/localized-versions) for you
- **RTL support**: locales reading right-to-left (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.) are supported and easy to implement
- **Default translations**: classic theme labels are translated for you in [many languages](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/docusaurus-theme-translations/locales)

## 案例展示

We worked with a few volunteers to **dogfood the i18n support** before releasing it.

### Jest：更新 Docusaurus

We have made it possible to **upgrade** a **translated Docusaurus 1 site** to Docusaurus 2.

**[Jest](https://jestjs.io)**, using Docusaurus 1 and Crowdin was one of those sites.

The Docusaurus 2 migration was successful and the new site is now deployed in production ([announcement post](https://jestjs.io/blog/2021/03/09/jest-website-upgrade)).

### Redwood：采用 Docusaurus

[Redwood](https://redwoodjs.com/) is a React full-stack Jamstack framework.

They were looking for a solution to create an **internationalized learning platform**, and became early adopters of Docusaurus 2 i18n for [learn.redwoodjs.com](https://learn.redwoodjs.com/), using Crowdin to get it translated to French.

### Datagit：使用 LTR 支持

The i18n system should work with any language, including **Right-to-Left languages**.

[Datagit.ir](https://datagit.ir/) is using Farsi, and a simple configuration option is able to **flip the Docusaurus theme** to add the required Right-to-Left support.
