# 📦 theme-search-algolia

This theme provides a `@theme/SearchBar` component that integrates with Algolia DocSearch easily. Combined with `@docusaurus/theme-classic`, it provides a very easy search integration. You can read more on [search](../../search.mdx) documentation.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @docusaurus/theme-search-algolia
```

This theme also adds search page available at `/search` (as swizzlable `SearchPage` component) path with OpenSearch support. You can change this default path via `themeConfig.algolia.searchPagePath`. 使用 `false` 禁用搜索页面。

:::tip

If you have installed `@docusaurus/preset-classic`, you don't need to install it as a dependency.
