# Swizzle

在本节中，我们将介绍如何在 Docusaurus 中完成自定义布局。

> 听起来有点耳熟……？

This section is similar to [Styling and Layout](./styling-layout.mdx), but this time, we will write actual React code instead of playing with stylesheets. We will talk about a central concept in Docusaurus: **swizzling**, which allows **deeper site customizations**.

In practice, swizzling permits to **swap a theme component with your own implementation**, and it comes in 2 patterns:

- [**Ejecting**](#ejecting): creates a **copy** of the original theme component, which you can fully **customize**
- [**Wrapping**](#wrapping): creates a **wrapper** around the original theme component, which you can **enhance**

<details>

<summary>Why is it called swizzling?</summary>

**The name comes from Objective-C and Swift-UI**: [method swizzling](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2019/swizzling-in-swift/) is the process of changing the implementation of an existing selector (method).

**For Docusaurus, component swizzling means providing an alternative component that takes precedence over the component provided by the theme.**

You can think of it as [Monkey Patching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) for React components, enabling you to override the default implementation. Gatsby has a similar concept called [theme shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/).

To gain a deeper understanding of this, you have to understand [how theme components are resolved](./advanced/client.mdx#theme-aliases).

</details>

## Swizzle 的过程

### 概览

Docusaurus provides an convenient **interactive CLI** to swizzle components. 你一般只需要记住以下指令：

```bash npm2yarn
npm run swizzle
```

It will generate a new component in your `src/theme` directory, which should look like this example:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Ejecting">
```

```jsx title="src/theme/SomeComponent.js"
import React from 'react';

export default function SomeComponent(props) {
  // You can fully customize this implementation
  // including changing the JSX, CSS and React hooks
  return (
    <div className="some-class">
      <h1>Some Component</h1>
      <p>Some component implementation details</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Wrapping">
```

```jsx title="src/theme/SomeComponent.js"
import React from 'react';
import SomeComponent from '@theme-original/SomeComponent';

export default function SomeComponentWrapper(props) {
  // You can enhance the original component,
  // including adding extra props or JSX elements around it
  return (
    <>
      <SomeComponent {...props} />
    </>
  );
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

要总览所有可用的主题和组件，请运行：

```bash npm2yarn
npm run swizzle -- --list
```

Use `--help` to see all available CLI options, or refer to the reference [swizzle CLI documentation](./cli.mdx#docusaurus-swizzle).

:::note

After swizzling a component, **restart your dev server** in order for Docusaurus to know about the new component.

:::

:::warning Prefer staying on the safe side

Be sure to understand [which components are **safe to swizzle**](#what-is-safe-to-swizzle). Some components are **internal implementation details** of a theme.

:::

:::info

`docusaurus swizzle` is only an automated way to help you swizzle the component. You can also create the `src/theme/SomeComponent.js` file manually, and Docusaurus will [resolve it](./advanced/client.mdx#theme-aliases). 这个命令背后没有什么内部的魔法！

:::

### Ejecting {#ejecting}

Ejecting a theme component is the process of **creating a copy** of the original theme component, which you can **fully customize and override**.

To eject a theme component, use the swizzle CLI interactively, or with the `--eject` option:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run swizzle [主题名] [组件名] -- --eject
```

举个例子：

```bash npm2yarn
npm run swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic Footer -- --eject
```

This will copy the current `<Footer />` component's implementation to your site's `src/theme` directory. Docusaurus will now use this `<Footer>` component copy instead of the original one. You are now free to completely re-implement the `<Footer>` component.

```jsx title="src/theme/Footer/index.js"
import React from 'react';

export default function Footer(props) {
  return (
    <footer>
      <h1>This is my custom site footer</h1>
      <p>And it is very different from the original</p>
    </footer>
  );
}
```

:::warning

Ejecting an [**unsafe**](#what-is-safe-to-swizzle) component can sometimes lead to copying a large amount of internal code, which you now have to maintain yourself. 这可能会使得升级 Docusaurus 变得更困难，因为如果接受的属性发生变化，或内部使用的主题 API 发生变化，你就不得不手动迁移你的变更。

**Prefer [wrapping](#wrapping) whenever possible**: the amount of code to maintain is smaller.

:::

:::tip Re-swizzling

To keep ejected components up-to-date after a Docusaurus upgrade, re-run the eject command and compare the changes with `git diff`. 也建议你在文件顶部写一个简短的注释，说明你做了哪些修改。这样你可以在重弹出后更容易地重新做更改。

:::

### Wrapping {#wrapping}

Wrapping a theme component is the process of **creating a wrapper** around the original theme component, which you can **enhance**.

To wrap a theme component, use the swizzle CLI interactively, or with the `--wrap` option:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run swizzle [主题名] [组件名] -- --wrap
```

举个例子：

```bash npm2yarn
npm run swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic Footer -- --wrap
```

This will create a wrapper in your site's `src/theme` directory. Docusaurus will now use the `<FooterWrapper>` component instead of the original one. 你现在可以在原始组件周围添加自定义内容。

```jsx title="src/theme/Footer/index.js"
import React from 'react';
import Footer from '@theme-original/Footer';

export default function FooterWrapper(props) {
  return (
    <>
      <section>
        <h2>Extra section</h2>
        <p>This is an extra section that appears above the original footer</p>
      </section>
      <Footer {...props} />
    </>
  );
}
```

<details>
  <summary>What is this <code>@theme-original</code> thing?</summary>

Docusaurus uses [theme aliases](./advanced/client.mdx#theme-aliases) to resolve the theme components to use. The newly created wrapper takes the `@theme/SomeComponent` alias. `@theme-original/SomeComponent` permits to import original component that the wrapper shadows without creating an infinite import loop where the wrapper imports itself.

</details>

:::tip

Wrapping a theme is a great way to **add extra components around existing one** without [ejecting](#ejecting) it. 比如，你可以轻松在每篇博文下面添加一个自定义的评论系统：

```jsx title="src/theme/BlogPostItem.js"
import React from 'react';
import BlogPostItem from '@theme-original/BlogPostItem';
import MyCustomCommentSystem from '@site/src/MyCustomCommentSystem';

export default function BlogPostItemWrapper(props) {
  return (
    <>
      <BlogPostItem {...props} />
      <MyCustomCommentSystem />
    </>
  );
}
```

## 哪些组件能被安全 swizzle？ {#what-is-safe-to-swizzle}

> 能力越大，责任越大

Some theme components are **internal implementation details** of a theme. Docusaurus allows you to swizzle them, but it **might be risky**.

<details>

<summary>Why is it risky?</summary>

主题作者（包括我们自己）可能会在未来更新主题：改变组件的属性、名字、文件系统位置、类型，等等。 For example, consider a component that receives two props `name` and `age`, but after a refactor, it now receives a `person` prop with the above two properties. Your component, which still expects these two props, will render `undefined` instead.

此外，一些内部组件可能会直接消失。 If a component is called `Sidebar` and it's later renamed to `DocSidebar`, your swizzled component will be completely ignored.

**Theme components marked as unsafe may change in a backward-incompatible way between theme minor versions.** When upgrading a theme (or Docusaurus), your customizations might **behave unexpectedly**, and can even **break your site**.

</details>

For each theme component, the swizzle CLI will indicate **3 different levels of safety** declared by theme authors:

- **Safe**: this component is safe to be swizzled, its public API is considered stable, and no breaking changes should happen within a theme **major version**
- **Unsafe**: this component is a theme implementation detail, not safe to be swizzled, and breaking changes might happen within a theme **minor version**
- **Forbidden**: the swizzle CLI will prevent you from swizzling this component, because it is not designed to be swizzled at all

:::note

有些组件可能能被安全包装，但不能被安全弹出。

:::

:::info

Don't be too **afraid to swizzle unsafe components**: just keep in mind that **breaking changes** might happen, and you might need to upgrade your customizations manually on minor version upgrades.

:::

:::note Report your use-case

If you have a **strong use-case for swizzling an unsafe component**, please [**report it here**](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/discussions/5468) and we will work together to find a solution to make it safe.

:::

## 我该 swizzle 哪个组件？ {#which-component-should-i-swizzle}

要 swizzle 哪个组件才能达成预期效果，答案并不是总是很清晰。 `@docusaurus/theme-classic`, which provides most of the theme components, has about [100 components](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/docusaurus-theme-classic/src/theme)!

:::tip

To print an overview of all the `@docusaurus/theme-classic` components:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic -- --list
```

:::

你可以按照这些步骤来定位合适的 swizzle 组件：

1. **Component description.** Some components provide a short description, which is a good way to find the right one.
2. **Component name.** Official theme components are semantically named, so you should be able to infer its function from the name. Swizzle CLI 允许你输入组件名称的一部分，以缩小选择范围。 For example, if you run `yarn swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic`, and enter `Doc`, only the docs-related components will be listed.
3. **Start with a higher-level component.** Components form a tree with some components importing others. Every route will be associated with one top-level component that the route will render (most of them listed in [Routing in content plugins](./advanced/routing.mdx#routing-in-content-plugins)). For example, all blog post pages have `@theme/BlogPostPage` as the topmost component. 你可以先 swizzle 这个组件，然后沿着组件树一步步往下走，最后定位到正好渲染你的目标区域的组件。 最后，在你找到正确的组件后，别忘了把其他文件全部删掉，这样你就不需要维护太多组件了。
4. **Read the [theme source code](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/docusaurus-theme-classic/src/theme)** and use search wisely.

:::tip Just ask!

## 我真的需要 swizzle 吗？ {#do-i-need-to-swizzle}

Swizzle 最终还是意味着你必须维护一些额外的 React 代码，这些代码会与 Docusaurus 的内部 API 交互。 如果可行的话，在个性化你的站点时，也考虑一下这些替代方案：

1. **Use CSS.** CSS rules and selectors can often help you achieve a decent degree of customization. Refer to [styling and layout](./styling-layout.mdx) for more details.
2. **Use translations.** It may sound surprising, but translations are ultimately just a way to customize the text labels. For example, if your site's default language is `en`, you can still run `yarn write-translations -l en` and edit the `code.json` emitted. Refer to the [i18n tutorial](./i18n/i18n-tutorial.mdx) for more details.

:::tip

**The smaller, the better.** If swizzling is inevitable, prefer to swizzle only the relevant part and maintain as little code on your own as possible. Swizzling a small component often means less risk of **breaking changes** during upgrade.

[Wrapping](#wrapping) is also a far safer alternative to [ejecting](#ejecting).

:::

## Wrapping your site with `<Root>` {#wrapper-your-site-with-root}

The `<Root>` component is rendered at the **very top** of the React tree, above the theme `<Layout>`, and **never unmounts**. 如果你有一个不需要在跳转时重新初始化的状态（比如用户身份验证状态、购物车状态……），它是添加这段逻辑的最佳位置。

Swizzle it **manually** by creating a file at `src/theme/Root.js`:

```js title="src/theme/Root.js"
import React from 'react';

// Default implementation, that you can customize
export default function Root({children}) {
  return <>{children}</>;
}
```

:::tip

用这个组件来渲染 React context provider。
