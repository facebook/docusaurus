# 创建文档

Create a Markdown file, `greeting.md`, and place it under the `docs` directory.

```bash
website # 你的网站的根目录
├── docs
│   └── greeting.md
├── src
│   └── pages
├── docusaurus.config.js
├── ...
```

```md

# Hello from Docusaurus

Are you ready to create the documentation site for your open source project?

## Headers

will show up on the table of contents on the upper right

So that your users will know what this page is all about without scrolling down or even without reading too much.

## Only h2 and h3 will be in the TOC by default.

You can configure the TOC heading levels either per-document or in the theme configuration.

The headers are well-spaced so that the hierarchy is clear.

- lists will help you
- present the key points
- that you want your users to remember
  - and you may nest them
    - multiple times
```

:::note

All files prefixed with an underscore (`_`) under the `docs` directory are treated as "partial" pages and will be ignored by default.

## Doc front matter {#doc-front-matter}

The [front matter](../markdown-features/markdown-features-intro.mdx#front-matter) is used to provide additional metadata for your doc page. 前言是可选的——Docusaurus 能够自行推断所有必要的元数据，无需前言。 For example, the [doc tags](#doc-tags) feature introduced below requires using front matter. For all possible fields, see [the API documentation](../../api/plugins/plugin-content-docs.mdx#markdown-front-matter).

## Doc tags {#doc-tags}

Tags are declared in the front matter and introduce another dimension of categorization in addition to the [docs sidebar](./sidebar/index.mdx).

It is possible to define tags inline, or to reference predefined tags declared in a [`tags file`](../../api/plugins/plugin-content-docs.mdx#tags-file) (optional, usually `docs/tags.yml`).

下面的示例：

- `docusaurus` references a predefined tag key declared in `docs/tags.yml`
- `Releases` is an inline tag, because it does not exist in `docs/tags.yml`

```md title="docs/my-doc.md"
---
tags:
  - Releases
  - docusaurus
---

# Title

Content
```

```yml title="docs/tags.yml"
docusaurus:
  label: 'Docusaurus'
  permalink: '/docusaurus'
  description: '与 Docusaurus 框架相关的文档'
```

:::tip

Tags can also be declared with `tags: [Demo, Getting started]`.

## Organizing folder structure {#organizing-folder-structure}

How the Markdown files are arranged under the `docs` folder can have multiple impacts on Docusaurus content generation. 然而，其中绝大多数可以与文件结构脱钩。

### Document ID {#document-id}

Every document has a unique `id`. By default, a document `id` is the name of the document (without the extension) relative to the root docs directory.

For example, the ID of `greeting.md` is `greeting`, and the ID of `guide/hello.md` is `guide/hello`.

```bash
website # 你的网站的根目录
└── docs
   ├── greeting.md
   └── guide
      └── hello.md
```

However, the **last part** of the `id` can be defined by the user in the front matter. For example, if `guide/hello.md`'s content is defined as below, its final `id` is `guide/part1`.

```md
---
id: part1
---

Lorem ipsum
```

当手写侧边栏，或这使用与文档相关的布局或钩子时，ID 会被用来指代某篇文档。

### Doc URLs {#doc-urls}

By default, a document's URL location is its file path relative to the `docs` folder, with a few exceptions. 也就是说，如果一个文件被命名为以下任意一个，文件名将不会被包含在 URL中：

- Named as `index` (case-insensitive): `docs/Guides/index.md`
- Named as `README` (case-insensitive): `docs/Guides/README.mdx`
- Same name as parent folder: `docs/Guides/Guides.md`

In all cases, the default slug would only be `/Guides`, without the `/index`, `/README`, or duplicate `/Guides` segment.

:::note

This convention is exactly the same as [the category index convention](./sidebar/autogenerated.mdx#category-index-convention). However, the `isCategoryIndex` configuration does _not_ affect the document URL.

:::

Use the `slug` front matter to change a document's URL.

比如，假设你的网站结构长得像这样：

```bash
website # 你的网站的根目录
└── docs
    └── guide
        └── hello.md
```

By default `hello.md` will be available at `/docs/guide/hello`. You can change its URL location to `/docs/bonjour`:

```md
---
slug: /bonjour
---

Lorem ipsum
```

`slug` will be appended to the doc plugin's `routeBasePath`, which is `/docs` by default. See [Docs-only mode](docs-introduction.mdx#docs-only-mode) for how to remove the `/docs` part from the URL.

:::note

你可以使用：

- absolute slugs: `slug: /mySlug`, `slug: /`...
- relative slugs: `slug: mySlug`, `slug: ./../mySlug`...

:::

If you want a document to be available at the root, and have a path like `https://docusaurus.io/docs/`, you can use the slug front matter:

```md
---
id: my-home-doc
slug: /
---

Lorem ipsum
```

### Sidebars {#sidebars}

When using [autogenerated sidebars](./sidebar/autogenerated.mdx), the file structure will determine the sidebar structure.

Our recommendation for file system organization is: make your file system mirror the sidebar structure (so you don't need to handwrite your `sidebars.js` file), and use the `slug` front matter to customize URLs of each document.
