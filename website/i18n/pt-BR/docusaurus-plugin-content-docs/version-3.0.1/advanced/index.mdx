# Advanced Tutorials

This section is not going to be very structured, but we will cover the following topics:

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```

We will assume that you have finished the guides, and know the basics like how to configure plugins, how to write React components, etc. These sections will have plugin authors and code contributors in mind, so we may occasionally refer to [plugin APIs](../api/plugin-methods/README.mdx) or other architecture details. Don't panic if you don't understand everythingðŸ˜‰
