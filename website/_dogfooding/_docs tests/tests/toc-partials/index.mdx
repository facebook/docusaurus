**The table of contents should include headings of this partial**:

<Partial />

---

**We can import the same partial using a different name and it still works**:

import WeirdLocalName from './_partial.mdx';

<WeirdLocalName />

---

**We can import a partial and not use it, the TOC remains unaffected**:

import UnusedPartial from './_partial.mdx';

---

import FirstLevelPartial from './_first-level-partial.mdx';

**It also works for partials importing other partials**

<FirstLevelPartial />

---

**And we can even use the same partial twice!**

**(although it's useless and not particularly recommended because headings will have the same ids)**

<FirstLevelPartial />
