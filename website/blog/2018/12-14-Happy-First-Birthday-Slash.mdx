![Docusaurus makes 1 year! Happy Birthday Slash!](/img/docusaurus-slash-first-birthday.svg)

Docusaurus [went live](https://v1.docusaurus.io/blog/2017/12/14/introducing-docusaurus) on December 14, 2017. At the time, we had [8 early adopters](https://v1.docusaurus.io/blog/2017/12/14/introducing-docusaurus#acknowledgements).

<!--truncate-->

We now have nearly [60 known users of Docusaurus](https://v1.docusaurus.io/en/users), and probably more that we don't know about. We have [9K GitHub stars](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) and an active community, particularly [Yangshun Tay](https://twitter.com/yangshunz) and [Endilie Yacop Sucipto](https://twitter.com/endiliey), both of whom are the lead maintainers helping keep this project [moving forward](https://docusaurus.io/blog/2018/09/11/Towards-Docusaurus-2).

Thank you to everyone for your support and use of this project! I am super proud of how far this project has come in just a year.

> Special thanks to [Eric Nakagawa](https://twitter.com/ericnakagawa), creator of Slash, for creating this 1-year image of Slash enjoying cake. The Slash brand has been a boon for us!
