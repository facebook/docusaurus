We are happy to announce **Docusaurus 3.2**.

The upgrade should be easy: as explained in our [release process documentation](/community/release-process), minor versions respect [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Highlights

### Faster builds

We worked hard to reduce the time it takes to build a Docusaurus site in production mode.

Between v3.1.0 and v3.2.0, several changes have been made, leading to significantly faster production builds for many sites.

Let's take an example. Our benchmark on the [React Native website upgrading to v3.2](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/pull/4072) reports the following results:

- üî• Cold builds: 95s ‚û°Ô∏è 66s (~30% faster)
- üî• Incremental builds: 55s ‚û°Ô∏è 22s (~60% faster)

The results will vary depending on your site's topology and the options you turned on, but we expect the largest sites will see the most significant improvements.

Note that this is only the beginning, and Docusaurus performance can still be significantly improved, notably the bundling time and the memory consumption. Track our [performance issue](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4765) for upcoming improvements.

<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between a cold build and an incremental build?</summary>

A cold build is when the Docusaurus caches are empty, generally after running `docusaurus clear`.

An incremental build happens when you run another time the `docusaurus build` command. Docusaurus automatically tries to "re-use" computations from former builds to make subsequent builds faster. In practice it's based on [Webpack persistent caching](https://webpack.js.org/guides/build-performance/#persistent-cache). To enable incremental builds on your CI server, you can persist the `node_modules/.cache` folder across builds.

### Faster Dev Server

We also worked on improving the performance of the dev server, so that you can get a faster feedback when editing Markdown/MDX files.

The way we initially implemented content reloading wasn't great. For example, editing a blog post file would also trigger a useless reload of the unrelated docs plugin. From now on, when editing a plugin's content, only that plugin will reload. It's hard to measure precisely the impact of this change, but I estimate edits should appear in your browser at least 50% faster üî•.

We plan to keep improving the speed of our dev server, with even more granular hot reloads, ensuring we don't run useless computations that would always keep giving the same result.

### MDX partials table-of-contents

With [#9684](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9684), Docusaurus is now able to render headings coming from an imported partial into the table-of-contents.

Docusaurus and MDX allows you to [import one Markdown file into another](/docs/markdown-features/react#importing-markdown). We usually call the imported Markdown file a "partial", and use the `_` prefix so that this file does not lead to the creation of a new page.

```md title="myDoc.mdx"
# My Doc

## Doc heading

Content is imported from another MDX file:

import ImportedDoc from './\_importedDoc.mdx';

<ImportedDoc />
```

```md title="_myPartial.mdx"
## Partial heading

Some paragraph
```

Previously, the heading `Partial heading` did not appear in the table-of-contents, but now it will!

### Blog improvements

We improved the blog plugin with several new options to make it even more powerful and flexible:

- [#9912](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9912): you can now display the last update time and author of a blog post, a feature the docs plugin already had.
- [#9886](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9886): a new `processBlogPosts` option allow you to filter/transform/sort blog posts.
- [#9838](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9838): a new `pageBasePath` option allows you to customize the blog pagination URL segment (`/blog/page/2`)

### Sitemap lastmod

With [#9954](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9954), the sitemap plugin has a new `lastmod` option that can now emit a `<lastmod>` tag on the XML. The value is read from the Git history by default, but can be overridden with docs and blog `last_update` front matter.

We also made it possible to opt-out of emitting `<priority>` and `<frequency>` tags, which are generally ignored by crawlers (notably [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/06/sitemaps-lastmod-ping)).

We recommend using the following sitemap plugin config, that will become the default in Docusaurus V4:

```js
{
  lastmod: 'date',
  priority: null,
  changefreq: null,
}
```
