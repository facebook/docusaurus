## Highlights

### Blog Social Icons

In [#10222](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/10222), we added the possibility to associate social links to blog authors, for inline authors declared in front matter or global through the `authors.yml` file.

```yml title="blog/authors.yml"
slorber:
  name: SÃ©bastien Lorber
  # other author properties...
  # highlight-start
  socials:
    x: sebastienlorber
    linkedin: sebastienlorber
    github: slorber
    newsletter: https://thisweekinreact.com
  # highlight-end
```

Icons and handle shortcuts are provided for pre-defined platforms `x`, `linkedin`, `github` and `stackoverflow`. It's possible to provide any additional platform entry (like `newsletter` in the example above) with a full URL.

### Blog Authors Pages

In [#10216](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/10216), we added the possibility for [global blog authors](/docs/blog#global-authors) (declared in `authors.yml`) to have their own dedicated page listing all the blog posts they contributed to.

This feature is opt-in and mostly relevant for **multi-author blogs**. You can turn it on for a specific author by setting the `page: true` property:

```yml title="blog/authors.yml"
slorber:
  name: SÃ©bastien Lorber
  # the description will be displayed on the author's page
  description: 'A freelance React and React-Native developer...'
  # highlight-next-line
  page: true # Turns the feature on
```

This creates a [dedicated author page](/blog/authors/slorber) at `/blog/authors/slorber`.

![Author page screenshot for `slorber` global author](./img/author-page.png)

An [authors index page](/blog/authors) is also created, listing all the blog authors.

Check the [blog authors pages guide](/docs/blog#authors-pages) for details.

### Blog Feeds Styling

In [#9252](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9252), we added support for [styling your blog feeds](https://darekkay.com/blog/rss-styling/) by providing custom XSLT `.xls` files for the RSS and Atom feeds. This allows browsers to render the feeds in a more visually appealing way, like a regular HTML page, instead of the default XML view.

```js title="website/docusaurus.config.js"
const blogOptions = {
  feedOptions: {
    // highlight-start
    xslt: {
      rss: 'custom-rss.xsl',
      atom: 'custom-atom.xsl',
    },
    // highlight-end
  },
};
```

Writing your own XSLT can be complex, but you can also use `xslt: true` to turn on the built-in style:

```js title="website/docusaurus.config.js"
const blogOptions = {
  feedOptions: {
    // highlight-start
    xslt: true,
    // highlight-end
  },
};
```

### Blog Sidebar Grouping

In [#10252](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/10252), we added support for grouping blog posts by years in the blog sidebar.

![Screenshot of the Docusaurus blog, in particular the sidebar items grouped by year](./img/blog-sidebar-years.png)

This feature is now turned on by default, but can be disabled with `themeConfig.blog.sidebar.groupByYear: false`.

### Blog Consistency Options

We added new blog options to enforce recommended practices for your blog posts:

#### `onInlineAuthors`

We believe large multi-blogs are easier to manage by using [global authors](/docs/blog#global-authors), declared in `authors.yml`. This notably permits to avoids duplicating author information across multiple blog posts, and now permits to generate [author pages](/docs/blog#authors-pages).

In [#10224](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/10224), we added the `onInlineAuthors` option. Use `onInlineAuthors: 'throw'` to forbid [inline authors](/docs/blog#inline-authors), and enforce a consistent usage of [global authors](/docs/blog#global-authors).

#### `onUntruncatedBlogPost`

We believe blog posts are better using [truncation markers](/docs/blog#blog-list) (`<!-- truncate -->` or `{/* truncate */}`). On paginated lists (blog home, tags pages, authors pages), this permits to render a more concise preview of the blog post instead of a full blog post.

In [#10375](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/10375), we added the `onUntruncatedBlogPost` option. Use `onUntruncatedBlogPost: 'throw'` to enforce a consistent usage of [truncation markers](/docs/blog#blog-list).
