## What is Docusaurus exactly?

Docusaurus is a **static site generator** that helps you ship **beautiful documentation websites** in **no time**.

Focus on your content: just write **Markdown files**. Docusaurus will generate an optimized **website** for you that's easy to **host anywhere**.

Docusaurus is **full-featured** and very **flexible**: we ship with well-designed docs and blog layout, as well as out-of-the-box versioning, search, and internationalization functionalities, with a call to accessibility and search engine optimizations. Its flexible theming system permits to **adapt the UI to match your branding** so that it integrates nicely with your main website or documentation portal. Its usage of **React** enables a **modern client-side navigation**, and the ability to build an **interactive documentation**.

![Introducing Slash](/img/slash-introducing.svg)

The Docusaurus philosophy is akin to the **Pareto principle**: you can get **80% of the results** for **20% of the effort**. This enables you to compete with top-notch documentation sites with **minimal effort**.

## The story behind Docusaurus

Docusaurus was created at **Facebook Open Source** in **2017** (now [Meta Open Source](https://opensource.fb.com/)). We had a lot of internal and open source projects to document. It's **complicated enough to write good documentation**, let alone to create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a good-looking website. We wanted project leaders to be able to **focus on the content**, and **Markdown** is great for that.

At that time, our solution was to **copy/paste a Jekyll template** over and over again. This naturally became **hard to maintain**, so we created a tool to **solve our own pain** once for all.

**[Docusaurus v1 was born](/blog/2017/12-14-introducing-docusaurus.mdx)!**

![Birth of Slash](/img/slash-birth.png)

It quickly built momentum at Facebook and in the frontend ecosystem, adopted by many popular projects such as [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [React-Native](https://archive.reactnative.dev/), [KaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/), and of course [Docusaurus v1](http://v1.docusaurus.io/) itself.

## Toward Docusaurus 2.0

[**Docusaurus v1**](http://v1.docusaurus.io/) has been very successful, but we started to **question some architectural choices**:

- React was only used as a **server-side templating language**, and not used on the client
- **Theming system was pretty limited**, and apart from changing a few colors with CSS, it was difficult to do more advanced customizations
- The **docs versioning system was confusing**, since it was based on a diff algorithm
- The codebase was **monolithic**, neither well-tested nor easy to extend

[**Docusaurus v2**](https://docusaurus.io/) was **rebuilt** from the ground up with a new **modular architecture**:

- React is now also used on the client, enabling a **modern Single Page Application navigation**
- **Plugins** empower the community to contribute useful features as third-party packages
- **Theming** is more **flexible** than ever
- Docs versioning is now based on snapshot copies, much easier to understand
- We kept **everything good from v1**: docs, blog, pages, versioning, i18n...
- We implemented **several new features**

More details in the [Docusaurus 2 project announcement](/blog/2018/09-11-Towards-Docusaurus-2.mdx) and [v1 to v2 migration guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/migration)

## Who uses Docusaurus 2.0?

Despite being in pre-release, it didn't take long for **Docusaurus v2 to outgrow Docusaurus v1** in terms of NPM downloads:

[![NPM downloads: v2 outgrows v1](./img/npm-downloads.png)](https://npmtrends.com/docusaurus-vs-@docusaurus/core)

Our GitHub star trend is very positive, competing with major frameworks:

[![GitHub stars: Docusaurus is well-positioned](./img/star-history.png)](https://star-history.com/#facebook/docusaurus&vercel/next.js&gatsbyjs/gatsby&hexojs/hexo&nuxt/nuxt.js&vuejs/vuepress&11ty/eleventy&gohugoio/hugo&remix-run/remix&mkdocs/mkdocs&Timeline)

Today, Docusaurus v2 has already been a great success even before its launch:

- We received so many [lovely testimonials](https://x.com/sebastienlorber/timelines/1392048416872706049)
- Companies like [1Password](https://blog.1password.com/docusaurus-documentation-framework/) and [Courier](https://www.courier.com/blog/how-we-built-our-documentation/) are writing down their positive experience
- Our [site showcase](/showcase) references hundreds of sites, and this is only the tip of the iceberg.

## What's New in 2.0?

It would be difficult to describe every single new feature coming with Docusaurus v2. Let's focus on the features we believe are the **most impactful**.

### MDX

[MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) allows you to **interleave React components** in Markdown. This enables you to build top-notch **interactive documentation experiences** very easily.

A demo is worth a thousand words:

```md title="docs/my-document.mdx"
### Give it a try: press that button!

import ColorModeToggle from '@theme/ColorModeToggle';

<ColorModeToggle/>
```

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>

<h3>Give it a try: press that button!</h3>

<ColorModeToggle/>

</BrowserWindow>
```

:::info

MDX has its own [plugin system](https://mdxjs.com/docs/extending-mdx/). You to customize your Markdown authoring experience, and even create your own Markdown syntax.

  Docusaurus + MDX is great: we were able to implement a beautiful two-pane
  layout and give the author fine-grained control on the placement of code and
  corresponding prose.
</TweetQuote>

### File system conventions

Our goal is to make Docusaurus very **intuitive** to use. We added file system conventions, and adding a doc page is as easy as creating one Markdown file.

  Using the auto-generated sidebars makes it so simple to just create a page and
  not worry about any other configuration.
</TweetQuote>

### Plugins

Docusaurus now has a **modular architecture** with a plugin system ‚Äî our **core features** like docs, blog, pages, and search are all powered by individual plugins.

More importantly, it enables our community to **enhance Docusaurus** with additional features.

Let's highlight some examples:

- [redocusaurus](https://github.com/rohit-gohri/redocusaurus): seamless integration with [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) and [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc)

![redocusaurus plugin example](./img/plugins/redocusaurus.png)

- [docusaurus-preset-shiki-twoslash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docusaurus-preset-shiki-twoslash): use [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) code block syntax highlighting with [TwoSlash](https://shikijs.github.io/twoslash/) TypeScript compiler hints

  The plugin API was a breeze to use, and powerful enough that I could port the
  code sample renderer from the TypeScript website site in a couple of hours.
</TweetQuote>

- [docusaurus-search-local](https://github.com/easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local): one of the various local search alternatives to the built-in Algolia plugin

![local search plugin example](./img/plugins/search.png)

  The plugin system in Docusaurus v2 has made expanding 1Password's developer
  portal so easy and fun. Super excited to show you what we've got cooking up.
</TweetQuote>

### Theming

Theming is one of the most important features of Docusaurus: we believe a professional documentation site should **respect your company's branding** and create a consistent experience.

Docusaurus theming gives a lot of **flexibility** on multiple levels:

- Customize CSS variables to adjust colors, fonts, and more
- Provide your own CSS stylesheets
- Implement your own theme from scratch
- **Override any React component** provided by our default theme: we call this [swizzling](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling)

  job="Creator of JestPreview">
  I love Docusaurus Swizzling feature. It‚Äôs opinionated and flexible at the same
  time. This is super cool since a framework usually needs to sacrifice one for
  the other.
</TweetQuote>

This enables users willing to invest a bit more time on **customizations** to build sites that **look different** from others.

  So far it‚Äôs working out really nicely. It‚Äôs been really easy to style up the
  way that we wanted it to look. No blockers at all.

  Recently, I was shocked at how good Docusaurus is out of the box. Super solid,
  a good bit of configuration without being overwhelming, and the ability to
  really customize the styling if you're braver than I am.

## Why 2.0 now?

Many enthusiastic followers of ours have been curious **why it took us 4 years to release Docusaurus 2.0**, considering the beta is already successful and **widely used in production**.

The reason is that we aim to **respect [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)**, which means we will be incrementing the major version number whenever we release a **breaking change**.

It is important for multiple reasons:

- It **guarantees simple minor version upgrades**, as long as you only use the [public API](/community/release-process#public-api-surface)
- It follows front-end ecosystem conventions
- A new major version is an opportunity to thoroughly document breaking changes
- A new major/minor version is an opportunity to communicate new features through a blog post

The problem is that our flexible theming system inherently creates a very **implicit API surface** on which it is **hard to know what is a breaking change** in the first place. Highly customized Docusaurus sites sometimes have a hard time upgrading Docusaurus because they achieve customizations using internal APIs. We dedicated time to extensive theme refactors and clearly defining our [public API](/community/release-process#public-api-surface), so that future code changes can be made more safely. We will continue to expand this public theming API so that the most common site customizations do not need to use any internal API.

:::info

From now on, Docusaurus will **release new major versions more frequently**. In practice, you can expect a **new major version every 2 to 4 months**.

[Major version numbers are not sacred](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2022/05/23/major-version-numbers-are-not-sacred.html), but we still group breaking changes together and avoid releasing major versions too often.

Check our [release process](/community/release-process) documentation for details.

## What's Next?

![Slash Up and Running](/img/slash-up-and-running.png)

The work on Docusaurus 3.0 has started, and this next version will be released only in a few months. We will **backport retro-compatible changes in Docusaurus 2.x** minor versions to make them available as soon as possible to the community on a stable channel.

A sample of the features on our roadmap for the upcoming major versions of Docusaurus:
