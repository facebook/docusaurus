# Docs Introduction

The docs feature provides users with a way to organize Markdown files in a hierarchical format.

:::info

Check the [Docs Plugin API Reference documentation](./../../api/plugins/plugin-content-docs.mdx) for an exhaustive list of options.

:::

Your site's documentation is organized by four levels, from lowest to highest:

1. Individual pages.
2. Sidebars.
3. Versions.
4. Plugin instances.

The guide will introduce them in that order: starting from [how individual pages can be configured](./docs-create-doc.mdx), to [how to create a sidebar or multiple ones](./sidebar/index.mdx), to [how to create and manage versions](./versioning.mdx), to [how to use multiple docs plugin instances](./docs-multi-instance.mdx).

## Docs-only mode {#docs-only-mode}

A freshly initialized Docusaurus site has the following structure:

```
example.com/                                -> generated from `src/pages/index.js`

example.com/docs/intro                      -> generated from `docs/intro.md`
example.com/docs/tutorial-basics/...        -> generated from `docs/tutorial-basics/...`
...

example.com/blog/2021/08/26/welcome         -> generated from `blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md`
example.com/blog/2021/08/01/mdx-blog-post   -> generated from `blog/2021-08-01-mdx-blog-post.mdx`
...
```

All docs will be served under the subroute `docs/`. But what if **your site only has docs**, or you want to prioritize your docs by putting them at the root?

Assume that you have the following in your configuration:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
export default {
  // ...
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        docs: {
          /* docs plugin options */
        },
        blog: {
          /* blog plugin options */
        },
        // ...
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

To enter docs-only mode, change it to like this:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
export default {
  // ...
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        docs: {
          // highlight-next-line
          routeBasePath: '/', // Serve the docs at the site's root
          /* other docs plugin options */
        },
        // highlight-next-line
        blog: false, // Optional: disable the blog plugin
        // ...
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

Note that you **don't necessarily have to give up on using the blog** or other plugins; all that `routeBasePath: '/'` does is that instead of serving the docs through `https://example.com/docs/some-doc`, they are now at the site root: `https://example.com/some-doc`. The blog, if enabled, can still be accessed through the `blog/` subroute.

Don't forget to put some page at the root (`https://example.com/`) through adding the front matter:

```md title="docs/intro.md"
---
# highlight-next-line
slug: /
---

This page will be the home page when users visit https://example.com/.
```

:::warning

If you added `slug: /` to a doc to make it the homepage, you should delete the existing homepage at `./src/pages/index.js`, or else there will be two files mapping to the same route!

:::

Now, the site's structure will be like the following:

```
example.com/                       -> generated from `docs/intro.md`
example.com/tutorial-basics/...    -> generated from `docs/tutorial-basics/...`
...
```

:::tip

There's also a "blog-only mode" for those who only want to use the blog feature of Docusaurus. You can use the same method detailed above. Follow the setup instructions on [Blog-only mode](../../blog.mdx#blog-only-mode).
