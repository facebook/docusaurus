# What's next?

Congratulations! You have understood most core features of Docusaurus now. You have:

- [Used the pages plugin](./creating-pages.md) to create a standalone React / Markdown page
- [Used the docs plugin](./docs/docs-introduction.md) to create documentation pages. This includes [configuring the sidebar](./docs/sidebar/index.md), and even [versioning](./docs/versioning.md)
- [Used the blog plugin](../blog.mdx) to create a fully featured blog
- Tried your hands on [a range of Markdown features](./markdown-features/markdown-features-intro.mdx), which are useful for all content plugins
- [Used stylesheets](../styling-layout.md) to customize your site's appearance
- [Put images and other assets](../static-assets.md) in your pages
- [Added search](../search.md) to your site
- Understood how [browser support](../browser-support.md) and [SEO](../seo.md) are done through standard Docusaurus APIs
- Learned about how [individual plugins](../using-plugins.md) are installed and configured
- [Deployed](../deployment.mdx) your site to a content host
- [Internationalized](../i18n/i18n-tutorial.md) your site to include multiple languages

At this point, you probably have a big `docusaurus.config.js` already😄 However, you haven't written much code yet! Most of the features are implemented through calling encapsulated Docusaurus APIs. As you continue your journey, you can take three paths:

- Learn more advanced Docusaurus concepts. This will help you gain a deeper understand of what the APIs do.
- Read about [all existing APIs](../docusaurus-core.md). Many of them have not been covered in the Guides!
- Learn to [develop a plugin](../api/plugin-methods/README.md) to extend the functionality of your site.
