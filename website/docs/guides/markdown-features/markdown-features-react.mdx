# MDX and React

```mdx-code-block
import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/BrowserWindow';
```

## Using JSX in Markdown {#using-jsx-in-markdown}

Docusaurus has built-in support for [MDX v1](https://mdxjs.com/), which allows you to write JSX within your Markdown files and render them as React components.

:::note

While Docusaurus parses both `.md` and `.mdx` files using MDX, some of the syntaxes are treated slightly differently by third-party tools. For the most accurate parsing and better editor support, we recommend using the `.mdx` extension for files containing MDX syntax.

:::

:::caution

MDX is not [100% compatible with CommonMark](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3018).

Use the **[MDX playground](https://mdx-git-renovate-babel-monorepo-mdx.vercel.app/playground)** to ensure that your syntax is valid MDX.

:::

Try this block here:

```jsx
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!
```

Notice how it renders both the markup from your React component and the Markdown syntax:

```mdx-code-block
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<BrowserWindow minHeight={240} url="http://localhost:3000">

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight>
{` `}and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!

</BrowserWindow>
```

<br />

You can also import your own components defined in other files or third-party components installed via npm! Check out the [MDX docs](https://mdxjs.com/) to see what other fancy stuff you can do with MDX.

:::caution

Since all doc files are parsed using MDX, any HTML is treated as JSX. Therefore, if you need to inline-style a component, follow JSX flavor and provide style objects. This behavior is different from Docusaurus 1. See also [Migrating from v1 to v2](../../migration/migration-manual.md#convert-style-attributes-to-style-objects-in-mdx).

## Importing code snippets {#importing-code-snippets}

You can not only import a file containing a component definition, but also import any code file as raw text, and then insert it in a code block, thanks to [Webpack raw-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/raw-loader/). In order to use `raw-loader`, you first need to install it in your project:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save raw-loader
```

Now you can import code snippets from another file as it is:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```jsx title="myMarkdownFile.mdx"
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import MyComponentSource from '!!raw-loader!./myComponent';

<CodeBlock className="language-jsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import MyComponentSource from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/pages/examples/_myComponent';

<BrowserWindow url="http://localhost:3000">

<CodeBlock className="language-jsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>

</BrowserWindow>

<br />
```

You can also pass `title` prop to `CodeBlock` component in order for it to appear as header above your code block:

```jsx
<CodeBlock className="language-jsx" title="/src/myComponent">
  {MyComponentSource}
</CodeBlock>
```

:::note

You have to use `<CodeBlock>` rather than the Markdown triple-backtick ` ``` `, because the latter will ship out any of its content as-is, but you want JSX to insert the imported text here.

:::

:::warning

This feature is experimental and might be subject to breaking API changes in the future.

:::

## Importing Markdown {#importing-markdown}

You can use Markdown files as components and import them elsewhere, either in Markdown files or in React pages.

By convention, using the **`_` filename prefix** will not create any doc page and means the markdown file is a **"partial"**, to be imported by other files.

```md title="_markdown-partial-example.mdx"
<span>Hello {props.name}</span>

This is text some content from `_markdown-partial-example.mdx`.
```

```jsx title="someOtherDoc.mdx"
import PartialExample from './_markdown-partial-example.mdx';

<PartialExample name="Sebastien" />;
```

```mdx-code-block
import PartialExample from './_markdown-partial-example.mdx';

<BrowserWindow url="http://localhost:3000">
  <PartialExample name="Sebastien" />
</BrowserWindow>

<br />
```

This way, you can reuse content among multiple pages and avoid duplicating materials.

:::caution

The table of contents does not currently contain the imported Markdown headings. This is a technical limitation that we are trying to solve ([issue](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3915)).

:::

## Available exports

Within the MDX page, the following variables are available as globals:

- `frontMatter`: the front matter as a record of string keys and values;
- `toc`: the table of contents, as a tree of headings. See also [Inline TOC](./markdown-features-inline-toc.mdx) for a more concrete use-case.
- `contentTitle`: the Markdown title, which is the first `h1` heading in the Markdown text. It's `undefined` if there isn't one (e.g. title specified in the front matter).

```jsx
import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

The table of contents for this page, serialized:

<CodeBlock className="language-json">{JSON.stringify(toc, null, 2)}</CodeBlock>

The front matter of this page:

<ul>
  {Object.entries(frontMatter).map(([key, value]) => <li key={key}><b>{key}</b>: {value}</li>)}
</ul>

<p>The title of this page is: <b>{contentTitle}</b></p>
```

```mdx-code-block
import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline';

<BrowserWindow>

The table of contents for this page, serialized:

<CodeBlock className="language-json">{JSON.stringify(toc, null, 2)}</CodeBlock>

The front matter of this page:

<ul>
  {Object.entries(frontMatter).map(([key, value]) => <li key={key}><b>{key}</b>: {value}</li>)}
</ul>

<p>The title of this page is: <b>{contentTitle}</b></p>

</BrowserWindow>
```
