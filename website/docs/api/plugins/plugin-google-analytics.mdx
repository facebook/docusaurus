# ðŸ“¦ plugin-google-analytics

import APITable from '@site/src/components/APITable';

The default [Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/) plugin. It is a JavaScript library for measuring how users interact with your website **in the production build**. If you are using Google Analytics 4 you might need to consider using [plugin-google-gtag](./plugin-google-gtag.mdx) instead.

:::danger Deprecated

This plugin is **deprecated**, and will become useless on July 1, 2023.

Google is [moving away from Universal Analytics](https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/prepare-for-future-with-google-analytics-4/).

If you are still using this plugin with a `UA-*` tracking id, you should create a Google Analytics 4 account as soon as possible, and use [`@docusaurus/plugin-google-gtag`](./plugin-google-gtag.mdx) instead of this plugin. More details [here](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/7221).
