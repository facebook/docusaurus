# Page B - File Path Links Test

This page links back to Page A and demonstrates cross-page linking.

## Links back to Page A

- [Go back to Page A](./page-a.md)

## Links to nested pages

- [Go to nested Page C](./nested/page-c.md)

## This proves it works!

If you can navigate to this page from Page A using the file path link, the feature is working correctly.
