# Nested Page C - File Path Links Test

This is a nested page that links back to parent-level pages using `../` relative paths.

## Links to parent pages

- [Go back to Page A (../)](../page-a.md)
- [Go back to Page B (../)](../page-b.md)

## Proves nested links work!

If you arrived here from Page A or Page B, and these links take you back, the nested file path resolution is working correctly.
