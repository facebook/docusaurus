# Page A - File Path Links Test

This page demonstrates that markdown file path links work correctly in the pages plugin.

## Links to sibling pages

- [Go to Page B (relative)](./page-b.md)
- [Go to Page B (without ./)](page-b.md)

## Links to nested pages

- [Go to nested Page C](./nested/page-c.md)

## Links using absolute paths from content root

- [Go to Page B (absolute from root)](/linking-test/page-b.md)
