  ! PLEASE HELP US HELP YOU !

  Bugs are fixed faster if you include:
  - a repro repository to inspect the code
  - an url to see the problem live (if possible)

  Pro tip: create a reproducible demo of the bug with https://new.docusaurus.io

  What happens if you skip this step?

  Someone will read your bug report, and maybe will be able to help you,
  but it’s unlikely that it will get much attention from the team. Eventually,
  the issue will likely get closed in favor of issues that have reproducible demos.

  Please remember that:

    * Issues without reproducible demos have a very low priority.
    * The person fixing the bug would have to do that anyway. Please be respectful of their time.
    * You might figure out the issues yourself as you work on extracting it.

  Thanks for helping us help you!
