        This template is strictly used for documentation requests, including:

        - Documenting undocumented APIs;
        - Elaborating on a particular topic;
        - Updating external links;
        - anything else that doesn't require touching the codebase itself.

        If you followed the documentation but things don't work, take some time to consider if it's the documentation or the code that's wrong. In the latter, prefer using the "bug" template.

        We seldom close documentation pull requests unmerged. If your documentation request is:

        - Relevant to a significant proportion of Docusaurus users;
        - Not about external tooling (e.g. deployment workflow. We have a "deployment" section but we have decided to keep it mostly as-is);
        - Not documented elsewhere (or, if it is documented, the mention is in very undiscoverable places).

        You may proceed directly to sending a pull request without filing this issue, and we can improve on your work.
        If you think some of the requirements above are not met, or if you are not able to contribute yourself, the issue is still welcomed.
