        Common reasons for proposals include:

        - Altering the infrastructure (e.g. swapping Webpack out with other bundlers);
        - Bumping a critical dependency's major version;
        - A significant improvement to a CLI command;
        - Significant refactor;
        - ...

        This is not for feature requests. If this involves new APIs or new behaviors, consider requesting the feature on https://docusaurus.io/feature-requests instead.

        We give you maximum freedom to write an elaborated proposal illustrating why you think the change is beneficial for us, and what steps we should take to turn this into reality.

        You should not use this to ditch the feature request or bug template; such action could make us identify the issue wrongly and close it without doing anything.
