import Partial1 from './_partial1.md';

import SomeComponent from './SomeComponent';

# Index

Some text

import Partial2 from './_partial2.md';

## Index section 1

Foo

<Partial1 />

Some text

<SomeComponent />

## Index section 2

<Partial2 />

## Unused partials

Unused partials (that are only imported but not rendered) shouldn't alter the TOC

import UnusedPartialImport from './_partial3.md';

## NonExisting Partials

Partials that do not exist should alter the TOC

It's not the responsibility of the Remark plugin to check for their existence

import DoesNotExist from './_doesNotExist.md';

<DoesNotExist />

## Duplicate partials

It's fine if we use partials at the end

<Partial1 />

And we can use the partial multiple times!

<Partial1 />
