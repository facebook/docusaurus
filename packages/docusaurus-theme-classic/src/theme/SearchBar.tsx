// By default, the classic theme does not provide any SearchBar implementation
// If you swizzled this file, it is your responsibility to provide an implementation
// Tip: swizzle the SearchBar from the Algolia theme for inspiration:
// npm run swizzle @docusaurus/theme-search-algolia SearchBar
export {default} from '@docusaurus/Noop';
