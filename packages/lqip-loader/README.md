# `@docusaurus/lqip-loader`

Low Quality Image Placeholders (LQIP) loader for webpack.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev @docusaurus/lqip-loader
```

## Example

Generating Base64 for a jpeg image imported in your JS bundle:

> The large image file will be emitted & only 400byte of Base64 (if set to true in the loader options) will be bundled.

### `webpack.config.js`

```js
{
  // OPTION A: default file-loader fallback
  test: /\.jpe?g$/,
  loaders: [
    {
      loader: '@docusaurus/lqip-loader',
      options: {
        path: '/media', // your image going to be in media folder in the output dir
        name: '[name].[ext]', // you can use [contenthash].[ext] too if you wish,
      }
    }
  ]

  // OPTION B: Chained with your own url-loader or file-loader
  test: /\.(png|jpe?g)$/,
  loaders: [
    '@docusaurus/lqip-loader',
    {
      loader: 'url-loader',
      options: {
        limit: 8000
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### `your-app-module.js`

```js
import banner from './images/banner.jpg';

console.log(banner.preSrc);
// outputs: "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhY....

console.log(banner.src); // that's the original image URL to load later!
```

### Important note

To save memory and improve GPU performance, browsers (including Chrome started from 61.0.3163.38) will now render a slightly more crisp or pixelated Base64 encoded images. If you want the blur to be very intense (smooth), here's a fix!

```css
img {
  filter: blur(25px);
}
```
