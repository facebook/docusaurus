### Introduction to Learning API Documentation

I’ve been writing API documentation for almost a decade now, and over the years I’ve learned what works, what doesn’t, and how to make documentation easier for developers to consume. APIs can seem overwhelming at first, but with the right structure and clarity, they become one of the most powerful tools for integration and product development.

This space will walk you through the fundamentals of API documentation—clear, practical, and beginner-friendly.

If you’re just getting started, the **Basic Guide** will help you understand API formats, requests, responses, endpoints, and best practices for writing clean docs.  
When you’re ready to go deeper, the **Advanced Guide** will cover topics like authentication models, workflows, versioning, testing calls, and writing docs that scale for complex systems.
