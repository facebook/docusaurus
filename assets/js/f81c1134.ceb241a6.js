But tags declared inline in the front matter are not always ideal.\\n\\nWith [#10137](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/10137), you can now declare a list of pre-defined tags in a `tags.yml` file:\\n\\n```yml title=\\"blog/tags.yml\\"\\ntag1:\\n  label: \'Tag 1\'\\n  description: \'Tag 1 description\'\\n  permalink: /tag-1-permalink\\n\\ntag2:\\n  label: \'Tag 2\'\\n  description: \'Tag 2 description\'\\n  permalink: /tag-2-permalink\\n```\\n\\nThese predefined tags can be used in the front matter of your blog or docs files:\\n\\n```md title=\\"blog/2024-05-31-my-blog-post.md\\"\\n---\\ntags: [tag1, tag2]\\n---\\n\\n# Title\\n\\nContent\\n```\\n\\n:::tip Keeping tags usage consistent\\n\\nUse the new `onInlineTags: \'throw\'` plugin option to enforce the usage of predefined tags and prevent contributors from creating new unwanted tags.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### Hash Router - Experimental\\n\\nWith [9859](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9859), we added a new **experimental** hash router config option, useful for **offline browsing** by opening your site locally through the `file://` protocol.\\n\\n```tsx title=\\"docusaurus.config.js\\"\\nexport default {\\n  future: {\\n    experimental_router: \'hash\',\\n  },\\n};\\n```\\n\\n:::warning\\n\\nThis mode is **not recommended for sites deployed through a web server**.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nWhen this mode is turned on, Docusaurus will opt out of static site rendering, and build a client-side single page application where all routes are prefixed with `/#/`. A single `index.html` file is generated. This file can be opened locally in your browser by simply clicking it, using the browser `file://` protocol. This makes it possible to distribute a Docusaurus site as a `.zip` file so that readers can browse it offline, without having to install anything complex on their computer apart a web browser.\\n\\n![Docusaurus hash router - local browsing using the file:// protocol](./img/hash.png)\\n\\nTry browsing our own Docusaurus site built with the hash router:\\n\\n- [Docusaurus website - Hash Router web deployment](https://facebook.github.io/docusaurus/#/)\\n- [Docusaurus website - Hash Router downloadable GitHub artifacts](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/actions/workflows/build-hash-router.yml)\\n\\n:::caution Experimental\\n\\nThis feature is **experimental**. If you try it out, please let us know how it works for you [here](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3825).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### Site Storage - Experimental\\n\\nDocusaurus uses the browser `localStorage` API to persist UI state.\\n\\nBut sometimes the storage space is \\"shared\\" between multiple sites using the same domain, leading to **storage key conflicts**. This generally happens in two cases\\n\\n- when working on multiple `http://localhost:3000` sites\\n- when hosting multiple sites under the same domain: `https://example.com/site1/` and `https://example.com/site2/`\\n\\nFor this reason, we introduced a new **experimental** `siteStorage` configuration option:\\n\\n```tsx\\nexport default {\\n  future: {\\n    experimental_storage: {\\n      type: \'localStorage\',\\n      namespace: true,\\n    },\\n  },\\n};\\n```\\n\\nWhen `namespace: true` is set, we apply a hash suffix to all the storage keys, making them unique to the current site (based on `config.url` and `config.baseUrl`. For example, the `theme` storage key becomes `theme-x6f`. It is also possible to provide your own custom suffix `namespace: \'suffix\'`. We also made it possible to use `type: \'sessionStorage\'` instead of the default `localStorage`.\\n\\n:::caution Experimental\\n\\nThis feature is **experimental**.

They also [published an upgrade guide and a **React v18.3 release**](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide) with new warnings to help us identify issues **before upgrading to React 19**.\\n\\nDocusaurus v3 depends on React `18.x`. When initializing a new Docusaurus sites, it will use that new React `18.3` release. It\'s also the case if you decide to upgrade your dependencies, or re-generate your package manager lockfile.\\n\\nIt turns out in its current state, **Docusaurus had a few of those extra warnings to fix**, notably this one immediately appearing on your dev console on any page load and navigation:\\n\\n> Warning: LoadableComponent uses the legacy contextTypes API which is no longer supported and will be removed in the next major release. Use React.createContext() with static contextType instead.\\n\\nIn [#10079](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/10079), we got Docusaurus ready for React 19. We fixed all the React 18.3 warnings we encountered. In case we missed any, don\'t hesitate to [**report new warnings**](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/10099) if you see them, to us but also to other Docusaurus third-party plugin authors.\\n\\n### `createSitemapItems`\\n\\nIn [#10083](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/10083), we introduced a new flexible `createSitemapItems()` hook to the sitemap plugin. This enables users to create/filter/transform/enhance the sitemap items with their own custom logic.\\n\\n```ts\\nexport default {\\n  presets: [\\n    [\\n      \'@docusaurus/preset-classic\',\\n      {\\n        sitemap: {\\n          // highlight-start\\n          createSitemapItems: async ({\\n            defaultCreateSitemapItems,\\n            ...params\\n          }) => {\\n            const items = await defaultCreateSitemapItems(params);\\n            return items.filter((item) => !item.url.includes(\'/tags/\'));\\n          },\\n          // highlight-end\\n        },\\n      },\\n    ],\\n  ],\\n};\\n```\\n\\n### Pages plugin improvements\\n\\nThe Docusaurus [pages plugin](/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-pages) has historically been lagging behind the docs and blog plugins in terms of available feature.\\n\\nIn [#10032](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/10032) we normalized the options available on each core content plugins by adding a few the missing page plugins APIs related to the edit url and the last update metadata displayed at the bottom on Markdown pages.\\n\\n```js\\nexport default {\\n  presets: [\\n    [\\n      \'@docusaurus/preset-classic\',\\n      {\\n        pages: {\\n          // highlight-start\\n          editUrl:\\n

\'@site/src/components/ErrorBoundaryTestButton\';\\n\\n## Highlights\\n\\n### Faster builds\\n\\nWe worked hard to reduce the time it takes to build a Docusaurus site in production mode.\\n\\nBetween v3.1.0 and v3.2.0, several changes have been made, leading to significantly faster production builds for many sites.\\n\\nLet\'s take an example. Our benchmark on the [React Native website upgrading to v3.2](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/pull/4072) reports the following results:\\n\\n- \ud83d\udd25 Cold builds: 95s \u27a1\ufe0f 66s (~30% faster)\\n- \ud83d\udd25 Incremental builds: 55s \u27a1\ufe0f 22s (~60% faster)\\n\\nThe results will vary depending on your site\'s topology and the options you turned on, but we expect the largest sites will see the most significant improvements.\\n\\nNote that this is only the beginning, and Docusaurus performance can still be significantly improved, notably the bundling time and the memory consumption. Track our [performance issue](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4765) for upcoming improvements.\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>What is the difference between a cold build and an incremental build?</summary>\\n\\nA cold build is when the Docusaurus caches are empty, generally after running `docusaurus clear`.\\n\\nAn incremental build happens when you run another time the `docusaurus build` command. Docusaurus automatically tries to \\"re-use\\" computations from former builds to make subsequent builds faster. In practice it\'s based on [Webpack persistent caching](https://webpack.js.org/guides/build-performance/#persistent-cache). To enable incremental builds on your CI server, you can persist the `node_modules/.cache` folder across builds.\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Faster Dev Server\\n\\nWe also worked on improving the performance of the dev server, so that you can get a faster feedback when editing Markdown/MDX files.\\n\\nThe way we initially implemented content reloading wasn\'t great. For example, editing a blog post file would also trigger a useless reload of the unrelated docs plugin. From now on, when editing a plugin\'s content, only that plugin will reload. It\'s hard to measure precisely the impact of this change, but I estimate edits should appear in your browser at least 50% faster \ud83d\udd25.\\n\\nWe plan to keep improving the speed of our dev server, with even more granular hot reloads, ensuring we don\'t run useless computations that would always keep giving the same result.\\n\\n### MDX partials table-of-contents\\n\\nWith [#9684](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9684), Docusaurus is now able to render headings coming from an imported partial into the table-of-contents.\\n\\nDocusaurus and MDX allows you to [import one Markdown file into another](/docs/markdown-features/react#importing-markdown). We usually call the imported Markdown file a \\"partial\\", and use the `_` prefix so that this file does not lead to the creation of a new page.\\n\\n```md title=\\"myDoc.mdx\\"\\n# My Doc\\n\\n## Doc heading\\n\\nContent is imported from another MDX file:\\n\\nimport ImportedDoc from \'./\\\\_importedDoc.mdx\';\\n\\n<ImportedDoc />\\n```\\n\\n```md title=\\"_myPartial.mdx\\"\\n## Partial heading\\n\\nSome paragraph\\n```\\n\\nPreviously, the heading `Partial heading` did not appear in the table-of-contents, but now it will!\\n\\n### Blog improvements\\n\\nWe improved the blog plugin with several new options to make it even more powerful and flexible:\\n\\n- [#9912](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9912): you can now display the last update time and author of a blog post, a feature the docs plugin already had.\\n- [#9886](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9886): a new `processBlogPosts` option allow you to filter/transform/sort blog posts.\\n- [#9838](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9838): a new `pageBasePath` option allows you to customize the blog pagination URL segment (`/blog/page/2`)\\n\\n### Sitemap lastmod\\n\\nWith [#9954](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9954), the sitemap plugin has a new `lastmod` option that can now emit a `<lastmod>` tag on the XML. The value is read from the Git history by default, but can be overridden with docs and blog `last_update` front matter.\\n\\nWe also made it possible to opt-out of emitting `<priority>` and `<frequency>` tags, which are generally ignored by crawlers (notably [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/06/sitemaps-lastmod-ping)).\\n\\nWe recommend using the following sitemap plugin config, that will become the default in Docusaurus V4:\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n  lastmod: \'date\',\\n  priority: null,\\n  changefreq: null,\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Other changes\\n\\n- [#9687](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9687): new Vercel Analytics plugin\\n- [#9681](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9681) and [#9442](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9442): `docusaurus swizzle` and `create-docusaurus` CLIs now ask users if they prefer to use TypeScript\\n- [#9928](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9928): new Icelandic translation\\n- [#9928](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9931): new `allContentLoaded` plugin lifecycle

we believe Docusaurus will help you build the **best documentation websites** with **minimal effort**, letting you **focus on what really matters**: writing the content.\\n\\nThis is a new **major version** of Docusaurus, coming with **new exciting features** and upgraded dependencies.\\n\\nIn line with the [**Semantic Versioning**](https://semver.org/) principles, this release includes **breaking changes** we documented thoroughly in the [**v3 upgrade guide**](/docs/migration/v3/). Breaking changes can be bothersome, but they are necessary to set the ground for a **new wave of Docusaurus features** we plan to implement.\\n\\n![v3.0 social-card image](./img/social-card.png)\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nWe initially planned to release more frequent major versions, but Docusaurus v3 has taken longer than expected. Among the breaking changes that we accrued, **upgrading to MDX v3** is probably the main challenge to the adoption of this new version. We went the extra mile to make this upgrade as easy as possible, notably by adding [compatibility options for MDX v1](/docs/api/docusaurus-config#markdown).\\n\\nThe simplest sites will only need to upgrade a few npm dependencies. For more complex sites, we came up with a few strategies that can help you upgrade more confidently:\\n\\n- [Prepare your site](/blog/preparing-your-site-for-docusaurus-v3) ahead of time, incrementally, while staying on Docusaurus v2\\n- [Set up visual regression tests](/blog/upgrading-frontend-dependencies-with-confidence-using-visual-regression-testing) to catch unexpected visual changes happening during the upgrade\\n\\n:::info About Docusaurus v2\\n\\nAccording to our [release process](/community/release-process#stable-version), Docusaurus v2 has now entered **maintenance mode**. It will only receive support for major security issues for 3 months, until 31 January 2024. It is recommended to upgrade within that time frame to v3.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nimport IframeWindow from \'@site/src/components/BrowserWindow/IframeWindow\';\\n\\n## Breaking changes\\n\\nThis section only gives you a quick glance. All the breaking changes are thoroughly documented in the [**v3 upgrade guide**](/docs/migration/v3).\\n\\nDocusaurus v3 upgraded a few dependencies to new major versions, each coming with its own breaking changes:\\n\\n- Node.js v16 \u27a1\ufe0f v18\\n- React v17 \u27a1\ufe0f v18\\n- MDX v1 \u27a1\ufe0f v3\\n- TypeScript v4 \u27a1\ufe0f v5\\n- prism-react-renderer v1 \u27a1\ufe0f v2\\n- react-live v2 \u27a1\ufe0f v4\\n- Mermaid v9 \u27a1\ufe0f v10\\n- import-fresh v3 \u27a1\ufe0f jiti v1\\n- remark-emoji v2 \u27a1\ufe0f v4\\n\\nA typical `package.json` dependency upgrade looks like:\\n\\n```diff title=\\"package.json\\"\\n {\\n   \\"dependencies\\": {\\n     // upgrade to Docusaurus v3\\n-    \\"@docusaurus/core\\": \\"2.4.3\\",\\n-    \\"@docusaurus/preset-classic\\": \\"2.4.3\\",\\n+    \\"@docusaurus/core\\": \\"3.0.0\\",\\n+    \\"@docusaurus/preset-classic\\": \\"3.0.0\\",\\n     // upgrade to MDX v3\\n-    \\"@mdx-js/react\\": \\"^1.6.22\\",\\n+    \\"@mdx-js/react\\": \\"^3.0.0\\",\\n     // upgrade to prism-react-renderer v2.0+\\n-    \\"prism-react-renderer\\": \\"^1.3.5\\",\\n+    \\"prism-react-renderer\\": \\"^2.1.0\\",\\n     // upgrade to React v18.0+\\n-    \\"react\\": \\"^17.0.2\\",\\n-    \\"react-dom\\": \\"^17.0.2\\"\\n+    \\"react\\": \\"^18.2.0\\",\\n+    \\"react-dom\\": \\"^18.2.0\\"\\n   },\\n   \\"devDependencies\\": {\\n     // upgrade Docusaurus dev dependencies to v3\\n-    \\"@docusaurus/module-type-aliases\\": \\"2.4.3\\",\\n-    \\"@docusaurus/types\\": \\"2.4.3\\"\\n+    \\"@docusaurus/module-type-aliases\\": \\"3.0.0\\",\\n+    \\"@docusaurus/types\\": \\"3.0.0\\"\\n   }\\n   \\"engines\\": {\\n     // require Node.js 18.0+\\n-    \\"node\\": \\">=16.14\\"\\n+    \\"node\\": \\">=18.0\\"\\n   }\\n }\\n```\\n\\nApart from MDX v3, most breaking changes coming with those upgraded dependencies have been handled internally for you: most of the time, you shouldn\'t have to do anything. Outside of dependencies, the only functional breaking changes coming explicitly from the Docusaurus codebase are:\\n\\n- [#9189](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9189): new default blog RSS feed limit of 20 entries\\n- [#9308](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9308): fix and re-introduce the `:::warning` admonition, deprecate `:::caution`\\n- [#9310](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9310): remove the legacy versioned sidebar id prefix, used for sites versioned before `v2.0.0-beta.10` (December 2021)\\n- [#7966](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/7966): refactor docs theme components, eventually requiring to you re-swizzle them\\n\\n## Highlights\\n\\nBelow is a non-exhaustive list of new useful features coming with this new version. All the features are listed in the [**Docusaurus v3.0.0 release notes**](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/releases/tag/v3.0.0).\\n\\n### Markdown\\n\\nDocusaurus v3 upgraded from MDX v1 to MDX v3:\\n\\n- in [#8288](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/8288), we upgraded to [**MDX v2**](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v2/) ([migration guide](https://mdxjs.com/migrating/v2/))\\n- in [#9451](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9451), we upgraded to [**MDX v3**](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v3/) ([migration guide](https://mdxjs.com/migrating/v3/))\\n\\nThis new MDX version is **much better for content writers and plugin authors**, and lays the ground for implementing new exciting Markdown features.\\n\\n:::warning MDX v3 - the main challenge\\n\\nThe transition from MDX v1 to MDX v3 is the **main challenge** to the adoption of Docusaurus v3.\\n\\nSome documents that compiled successfully under Docusaurus v2 might now **fail to compile** under Docusaurus v3, while others might **render differently**.\\n\\nMost breaking changes come from [MDX v2](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v2/), and [MDX v3](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v3/) is a relatively small release. The [MDX v2 migration guide](https://mdxjs.com/migrating/v2/) has a section on how to [update MDX files](https://mdxjs.com/migrating/v2/#update-mdx-files) that will be particularly relevant to us. Also make sure to read the [Troubleshooting MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/troubleshooting-mdx/) page that can help you interpret common MDX error messages.\\n\\n**Don\'t be intimidated**. Most problems are **easy to fix** and often related to `{` and `<` characters that you now need to escape. However, depending on the size of your site, you might need to edit many files and feel overwhelmed. For this reason, we provide a command [`npx docusaurus-mdx-checker`](https://github.com/slorber/docusaurus-mdx-checker) to help you get an estimate of the work to be done, and we recommend to [prepare your site in advance](/blog/preparing-your-site-for-docusaurus-v3).\\n\\nIf you created custom [MDX plugins](/docs/markdown-features/plugins) (Remark/Rehype), the AST is slightly different, and you might need to refactor them.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nThis notably enables us to add a [CommonMark mode](/docs/markdown-features#mdx-vs-commonmark) that should make it easier for existing documentations to adopt Docusaurus. It is currently opt-in and **experimental** and limited ([some Docusaurus features will not work](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/9092)). In Docusaurus v3, all files are still interpreted as MDX, but we plan to interpret `.md` files as CommonMark in an upcoming major version, and recommend to use the `.mdx` extension for any file using JSX or ES modules.\\n\\nWe also introduced a new way to [configure Markdown globally for your site](/docs/api/docusaurus-config#markdown), and plan to add more flexible options later.\\n\\n```js title=\\"docusaurus.config.js\\"\\nexport default {\\n  markdown: {\\n    format: \'mdx\',\\n    mermaid: true,\\n    preprocessor: ({filePath, fileContent}) => {\\n      return fileContent.replaceAll(\'{{MY_VAR}}\', \'MY_VALUE\');\\n    },\\n    mdx1Compat: {\\n      comments: true,\\n      admonitions: true,\\n      headingIds: true,\\n    },\\n  },\\n};\\n```\\n\\nDocusaurus now uses the [remark-directive](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-directive) plugin to support admonitions. This also offers you the ability to create your own Remark plugins to extend Markdown with your own [custom directives](https://talk.commonmark.org/t/generic-directives-plugins-syntax/444) such as `:textDirective`, `::leafDirective` or `:::containerDirective`.\\n\\n### ESM and TypeScript configs {#esm-ts-configs}\\n\\nIn [#9317](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9317), we added support for ES Modules and TypeScript config files, including site config, docs sidebars, plugins and presets.\\n\\nHere are 2 TypeScript examples, giving you a modern experience with IDE autocompletion:\\n\\n```ts title=\\"docusaurus.config.ts\\"\\nimport type {Config} from \'@docusaurus/types\';\\nimport type * as Preset from \'@docusaurus/preset-classic\';\\n\\nconst config: Config = {\\n  title: \'My Site\',\\n  favicon: \'img/favicon.ico\',\\n  // your site config ...\\n  presets: [\\n    [\\n      \'classic\',\\n      {\\n        // your preset config ...\\n      } satisfies Preset.Options,\\n    ],\\n  ],\\n  themeConfig: {\\n    // your theme config ...\\n  } satisfies Preset.ThemeConfig,\\n};\\n\\nexport default config;\\n```\\n\\n```ts title=\\"sidebars.ts\\"\\nimport type {SidebarsConfig} from \'@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs\';\\n\\nconst sidebars: SidebarsConfig = {\\n  docs: [\'introduction\'],\\n};\\n\\nexport default sidebars;\\n```\\n\\n### Unlisted content\\n\\nDocusaurus already supported a `draft: true` front matter option in our 3 content plugins (docs, blog, pages), which allows you to remove some pages from your production builds.\\n\\nIn [#8004](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/8004), we introduced a new `unlisted: true` front matter option, which will keep your pages available in production builds, while \\"hiding\\" them and making them impossible to discover unless you have the url. This enables convenient workflows where you can easily ask for feedback on a piece of content before the final publication.\\n\\nUnlisted content will:\\n\\n- be excluded from `sitemap.xml`\\n- be excluded from SEO results thanks to `<meta name=\\"robots\\" content=\\"noindex, nofollow\\" />`\\n- be excluded from blog RSS feeds\\n- be excluded from Algolia DocSearch results\\n- be filtered from site navbar items, docs sidebars, blog sidebar, blog archives, tags pages...\\n\\nUnlisted content will also display a banner so that you don\'t forget to turn it off once your content is ready for prime time. Here\'s an example of an [unlisted blog post](/tests/blog/unlisted-post):\\n\\n<IframeWindow url=\\"/tests/blog/unlisted-post\\" />\\n\\n### React 18\\n\\nIn [#8961](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/8961), we upgraded to React 18. This is important, notably for the [gradual adoption of Concurrent React features](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#gradually-adopting-concurrent-features), as well as upcoming exciting features such as [build-time React Server Components](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/9089).\\n\\nThis new version of React should be a drop-in replacement for most Docusaurus sites. It comes with breaking changes that we handled internally in the Docusaurus codebase. If your site is using a lot of custom React code, we recommend you to take a look at the official article on [How to Upgrade to React 18](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide), notably the new [automatic batching](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide#automatic-batching) behavior.\\n\\n:::danger Experimental support for React 18 features\\n\\nReact 18 comes with new features:\\n\\n- `<Suspense>`\\n- `React.lazy()`\\n- `startTransition()`\\n\\nTheir Docusaurus support is considered as **experimental**. We might have to adjust the integration in the future, leading to a different runtime behavior.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### Automatic JSX runtime\\n\\nDocusaurus now uses the [\\"automatic\\" JSX runtime](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html).\\n\\nIt is not needed anymore to import React in JSX files that do not use any React API.\\n\\n```diff title=\\"src/components/MyComponent.js\\"\\n- import React from \'react\';\\n\\n  export default function MyComponent() {\\n    return <div>Hello</div>;\\n  }\\n```\\n\\n### Debug builds\\n\\nIt is now possible to build your static site in dev mode.\\n\\n```bash\\ndocusaurus build --dev\\n```\\n\\n:::tip Debug React-related problems\\n\\nDocusaurus will log more errors to the console, notably React 18 hydration errors through the new [`onRecoverableError` callback](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#parameters).\\n\\nThis new build mode is particularly helpful for **troubleshooting React problems**. Docusaurus will use the development build of React, thus producing detailed and readable error messages instead of minified ones linking to the [React Error Decoder page](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-decoder.html/).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### TypeScript\\n\\nDocusaurus v3 now requires a minimum version of TypeScript 5.0.\\n\\nWe re-internalized the base recommended TypeScript config to a new official package:\\n\\n```diff title=\\"tsconfig.json\\"\\n {\\n-  \\"extends\\": \\"@tsconfig/docusaurus/tsconfig.json\\",\\n+  \\"extends\\": \\"@docusaurus/tsconfig\\",\\n   \\"compilerOptions\\": {\\n     \\"baseUrl\\": \\".\\"\\n   }\\n }\\n```\\n\\nWe also have cleaner, normalized exports for Docusaurus core type, plugin, and preset options, which you can use within the brand-new [TypeScript config files](#esm-ts-configs):\\n\\n```ts title=\\"docusaurus.config.ts\\"\\nimport type {Config} from \'@docusaurus/types\';\\nimport type {Options, ThemeConfig} from \'@docusaurus/preset-classic\';\\nimport type {SidebarsConfig} from \'@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs\';\\n```\\n\\n### Code blocks\\n\\nIn [#9316](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9316), we improved on syntax highlighting thanks to the [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer) v2 upgrade. For example, a bash param `--save` is now colored:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install --save some-package\\n```\\n\\nThe [interactive code editor](/docs/markdown-features/code-blocks#interactive-code-editor) also upgrades to [react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) v4, coming with a new [sucrase](https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase) compiler. It is faster, lighter, and supports modern features, notably TypeScript type annotations.\\n\\n```js live\\nfunction Hello() {\\n  const name: string = \'World\';\\n  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn [#8982](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/8982) and [#8870](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/8870), we also added [magic comments](/docs/markdown-features/code-blocks#custom-magic-comments) support for TeX-like, Haskell-like, and WebAssembly comment syntax.\\n\\n```haskell title=\\"haskell.hs\\"\\nstringLength :: String -> Int\\n-- highlight-next-line\\nstringLength [] = 0\\nstringLength (x:xs) = 1 + stringLength xs\\n```\\n\\n```matlab title=\\"matlab.m\\"\\n% highlight-start\\nfunction result = times2(n)\\n  result = n * 2;\\nend\\n% highlight-end\\nx = 10;\\n% highlight-next-line\\ny = times2(x);\\n```\\n\\n### Mermaid diagrams\\n\\nIn [#9305](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9305), we upgraded to Mermaid v10.4 and added support for async diagram rendering. Docusaurus is now able to render new types of diagrams.\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Mindmap</summary>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nmindmap\\n  root((mindmap))\\n    Research\\n      Creative techniques\\n      Strategic planning\\n      Argument mapping\\n    Tools\\n      Pen and paper\\n      Mermaid\\n```\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Quadrant chart</summary>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nquadrantChart\\n  title Reach and engagement of campaigns\\n  x-axis Low Reach --\x3e High Reach\\n  y-axis Low Engagement --\x3e High Engagement\\n  quadrant-1 We should expand\\n  quadrant-2 Need to promote\\n  quadrant-3 Re-evaluate\\n  quadrant-4 May be improved\\n  Campaign A: [0.3, 0.6]\\n  Campaign B: [0.45, 0.23]\\n  Campaign C: [0.57, 0.69]\\n  Campaign D: [0.78, 0.34]\\n  Campaign E: [0.40, 0.34]\\n  Campaign F: [0.35, 0.78]\\n```\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n### Query-string data attributes\\n\\nIn [#9028](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9028), we made it possible to set custom HTML [data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*) though `docusaurus-data-x` query-string parameters. This makes it easier to embed a Docusaurus iframe on another site, and lets you customize the appearance of the embedded version with CSS.\\n\\n```css title=\\"/src/css/custom.css\\"\\nhtml[data-navbar=\'false\'] .navbar {\\n  display: none;\\n}\\n\\nhtml[data-red-border] div#__docusaurus {\\n  border: red solid thick;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n<IframeWindow url=\\"/docs/?docusaurus-data-navbar=false&docusaurus-data-red-border\\" />\\n\\n### Other features\\n\\nOther new features worth mentioning:\\n\\n- [#9189](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9189): new blog `feedOptions.limit` option\\n- [#9071](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9071): add normalized SEO front matter support for the pages plugin\\n- [#9171](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9028): the client-redirects plugin now supports fully qualified urls and query-string/hash in destination url\\n- [#9171](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/9171): new ESLint rule [`no-html-links`](/docs/api/misc/@docusaurus/eslint-plugin/no-html-links)\\n- [#8384](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/8384): new ESLint rule [`prefer-docusaurus-heading`](/docs/api/misc/@docusaurus/eslint-plugin/prefer-docusaurus-heading)\\n\\nRead [**Docusaurus v3.0.0 release notes**](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/releases/tag/v3.0.0) for an exhaustive list of changes.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThis release comes with a few features, but more importantly **upgrades many pieces of the Docusaurus infrastructure**.\\n\\nThe **MDX upgrade** consumed a lot of our time this year, and we worked hard to make this important upgrade less difficult for all of you.\\n\\nNow that we\'ve caught up with our infrastructure, we\'ll be back **delivering useful documentation features** very soon, in upcoming minor versions.\\n\\nWe would like to thank you for using Docusaurus over the years. The documentation framework space is becoming more competitive lately, and we will do our best to ensure that Docusaurus remains a **competitive solution** that stands out for its great **flexibility**."},{"id":"/preparing-your-site-for-docusaurus-v3","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/preparing-your-site-for-docusaurus-v3","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/edit/main/website/blog/2023/09-29-preparing-your-site-for-docusaurus-v3/index.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2023/09-29-preparing-your-site-for-docusaurus-v3/index.mdx","title":"Preparing your site for Docusaurus v3","description":"This blog post was written when Docusaurus v3 was in beta.

This is the perfect time to start **preparing your site** for this new major version.\\n\\nDocusaurus v3 comes with a few **breaking changes**, many of which can be **handled today under Docusaurus v2**. Preparing your site ahead of time can be done incrementally, and will make it easier to upgrade to v3.\\n\\nThe main breaking change is the upgrade from MDX v1 to MDX v3. Read the [**MDX v2**](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v2/) and [**MDX v3**](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v3/) release notes for details. MDX will now compile your Markdown content **more strictly** and with **subtle differences**.\\n\\nThis article will mostly focus on how to prepare your content for this new MDX version, and will also list a few other breaking changes that you can handle today.\\n\\n![Preparing your site for Docusaurus v3 - social card](./img/social-card.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n:::warning\\n\\nThis article mentions most Docusaurus v3 breaking changes, but is not exhaustive. Read the [v3.0.0-beta.0 release notes](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/discussions/9312) for an exhaustive list.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::tip Don\'t be afraid\\n\\nThere\'s a lot of content in this blog post, but many Docusaurus v2 sites can upgrade with very few changes.\\n\\nIf your site is relatively small, with only a few customizations, you can probably [upgrade to Docusaurus v3](#try-docusaurus-v3-today) immediately.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Preparatory work\\n\\nBefore preparing for the Docusaurus v3 upgrade, we recommend upgrading to the latest [Docusaurus v2 version](/versions).\\n\\nDepending on the complexity of your site, it may be a good idea to adopt the [visual regression testing workflow](/blog/upgrading-frontend-dependencies-with-confidence-using-visual-regression-testing) that we recently presented. It could help you catch unexpected visual side effects occurring during the Docusaurus v3 upgrade.\\n\\nWe also recommend using the `.mdx` extension whenever you use JSX, `import`, or `export` (i.e. MDX features) inside a Markdown file. It is semantically more correct and improves compatibility with external tools (IDEs, formatters, linters, etc.). In future versions of Docusaurus, `.md` files will be parsed as standard [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), which does not support these features. In Docusaurus v3, `.md` files keep being compiled as MDX files, but it will be possible to [opt-in for CommonMark](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3018).\\n\\n## Preparing content for MDX v3\\n\\nMDX is a major dependency of Docusaurus responsible for compiling your `.md` and `.mdx` files to React components.\\n\\nMDX v3 is much better, but also comes with changes that probably require you to refactor your content a bit. MDX v3 is stricter, and some components that compiled fine under v1 might now fail to compile under v3, most likely because of `{` and `<` characters.\\n\\nUpgrading MDX comes with all the breaking changes documented on the [MDX v2](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v2/) and [MDX v3](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v3/) release blog posts. Most breaking changes come from MDX v2. The [MDX v2 migration guide](https://mdxjs.com/migrating/v2/) has a section on how to [update MDX files](https://mdxjs.com/migrating/v2/#update-mdx-files) that will be particularly relevant to us. Also make sure to read the [Troubleshooting MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/troubleshooting-mdx/) page that can help you interpret common MDX error messages.\\n\\nMake sure to also read our updated [**MDX and React**](/docs/markdown-features/react) documentation page.\\n\\n:::tip Ask for help\\n\\nWe have a dedicated [MDX v3 - Upgrade Support](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/discussions/9053) discussion.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### Using the MDX playground\\n\\nThe MDX playground is your new best friend. It permits to understand how your content is **compiled to React components**, and troubleshoot compilation or rendering issues in isolation.\\n\\nEach MDX version comes with its own playground:\\n\\n- [MDX playground - current version](https://mdxjs.com/playground/)\\n- [MDX playground - v1](https://mdx-git-renovate-babel-monorepo-mdx.vercel.app/playground/)\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Configuring the MDX playground options for Docusaurus</summary>\\n\\nTo obtain a compilation behavior similar to what Docusaurus v2 uses, please turn on these options on the [MDX playground](https://mdxjs.com/playground/):\\n\\n- Use `MDX`\\n- Use `remark-gfm`\\n- Use `remark-directive`\\n\\n![Screenshot of the MDX playground\'s options panel, with only the \\"Use `MDX`\\", \\"Use `remark-gfm`\\", and \\"Use `remark-directive`\\" options checked](./img/mdx2-playground-options.png)\\n\\n</details>\\n\\nUsing the two MDX playgrounds side-by-side, you will soon notice that some content is compiled differently or fails to compile in v3.\\n\\n:::tip Making your content future-proof\\n\\nThe goal will be to refactor your problematic content so that it **works fine with both versions of MDX**. This way, when you upgrade to Docusaurus v3, this content will already work out-of-the-box.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### Using the MDX checker CLI\\n\\nWe provide a [docusaurus-mdx-checker](https://github.com/slorber/docusaurus-mdx-checker) CLI that permits to easily spot problematic content. Run this command today on your Docusaurus v2 site to obtain a list of files that will fail to compile under MDX v3.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx docusaurus-mdx-checker\\n```\\n\\nFor each compilation issue, the CLI will log the file path and a line number to look at.\\n\\n![Screenshot of the terminal showing an example MDX checker CLI output, with a few error messages](./img/mdx-checker-output.png)\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nUse this CLI to estimate of how much work will be required to make your content compatible with MDX v3.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::warning\\n\\nThis CLI is a best effort, and will only report compilation errors.\\n\\nIt will not report subtle compilation changes that do not produce errors but can affect how your content is displayed. To catch these problems, we recommend using [visual regression tests](/blog/upgrading-frontend-dependencies-with-confidence-using-visual-regression-testing).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### Common MDX problems\\n\\nWe upgraded a few Docusaurus sites to Docusaurus v3 and MDX v3:\\n\\n- [Docusaurus PR](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/8288)\\n- [React-Native PR](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/pull/3780)\\n- [Jest PR](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/pull/14463)\\n\\nThese upgrades permitted us to aggregate the most common content problems, and document how to best handle them.\\n\\n#### Bad usage of `{`\\n\\nThe `{` character is used for opening [JavaScript expressions](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/#expressions).

We recommend that you migrate your config file to ES module, that enables you to import the Remark plugins easily:\\n\\n```js title=\\"docusaurus.config.js\\"\\nimport remarkPlugin from \'remark-plugin\';\\n\\nexport default {\\n  title: \'Docusaurus\',\\n  /* site config using remark plugins here */\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to keep using CommonJS modules, you can use dynamic imports as a workaround that enables you to import ES modules inside a CommonJS module. Fortunately, the [Docusaurus config supports the usage of an async function](/docs/configuration#syntax-to-declare-docusaurus-config) to let you do so.\\n\\n```js title=\\"docusaurus.config.js\\"\\nmodule.exports = async function () {\\n  const myPlugin = (await import(\'remark-plugin\')).default;\\n  return {\\n    // site config...\\n  };\\n};\\n```\\n\\n:::\\n\\n:::info For plugin authors\\n\\nIf you created custom Remark or Rehype plugins, you may need to refactor those, or eventually rewrite them completely, due to how the new AST is structured. We have created a [dedicated support discussion](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/discussions/9337) to help plugin authors upgrade their code.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Other breaking changes\\n\\nApart from MDX, there are other breaking changes that you can already prepare your site for, notably major version upgrades of important dependencies.\\n\\n### Node.js 18.0\\n\\nNode.js 16 [reached End-of-Life](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/nodejs16-eol), and Docusaurus v3 now requires **Node.js >= 18.0**.\\n\\n:::tip How to prepare\\n\\nUpgrade your Docusaurus v2 site to Node.js 18 before upgrading to Docusaurus v3.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### React 18.0\\n\\nDocusaurus v3 now requires **React >= 18.0**.\\n\\nReact 18 comes with its own breaking changes that should be relatively easy to handle, depending on the amount of custom React code you created for your site.\\n\\nSimple Docusaurus sites that only use our official theme code without swizzling do not have anything to do.\\n\\n:::tip How to prepare\\n\\nRead the official [React v18.0](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18) and [How to Upgrade to React 18](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide), and look at your first-party React code to figure out which components might be affected this React 18 upgrade.\\n\\nWe recommend to particularly look for:\\n\\n- Automatic batching for stateful components\\n- New React hydration errors reported to the console\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### TypeScript 5.0\\n\\nDocusaurus v3 now requires **TypeScript >= 5.0**.\\n\\n:::tip How to prepare\\n\\nUpgrade your Docusaurus v2 site to TypeScript 5 before upgrading to Docusaurus v3.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### TypeScript base config\\n\\nThe official Docusaurus TypeScript config has been re-internalized from the external package [`@tsconfig/docusaurus`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tsconfig/docusaurus) to our new monorepo package [`@docusaurus/tsconfig`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@docusaurus/tsconfig).\\n\\nThis new package is versioned alongside all the other Docusaurus core packages, and will be used to ensure TypeScript retro-compatibility and breaking changes on major version upgrades.\\n\\n:::tip How to prepare\\n\\nThe new Docusaurus v3 TypeScript config is sensibly the same as the former Docusaurus v2 TypeScript config.

It is not directly coupled to Docusaurus or React, and can be adapted to work with other frontend applications and frameworks.\\n\\n![Upgrading frontend dependencies with confidence - social card](./img/social-card.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThis workflow has been tested while upgrading Docusaurus v2 to v3, and already helped catch a few visual regressions on sites such as [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), and the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) site itself.\\n\\nDocusaurus v3 comes with infrastructure changes and major dependency upgrades such as [MDX v3](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v3/) and [React 18](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18), which can produce unexpected side effects. It would have been difficult to notice all the visual regressions without such a workflow. That\'s why we encourage site owners to consider adopting visual regression testing, especially for highly customized sites.\\n\\n## Workflow overview\\n\\nThe general idea is pretty simple:\\n\\n- Build your site in CI with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)\\n- Take screenshots of all `sitemap.xml` pages with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)\\n- Upload them to [Argos](https://argos-ci.com/)\\n- Do this for both Git branches `main` and `pr-branch`\\n- Compare the screenshots side-by-side in [Argos](https://argos-ci.com/)\\n\\nArgos will then **report visual differences** found between `main` and `pr-branch` as a GitHub commit status and pull-request comment. This can help you detect visual regressions ahead of time in an automated way.\\n\\n![Argos GitHub commit status](./img/argos-github-status.png)\\n\\n![Argos GitHub PR comment](./img/argos-github-comment.png)\\n\\nArgos creates a report referencing all the visual differences found while comparing the 2 Git branches sites side-by-side, and provides a convenient UX to easily spot the difference.\\n\\nCheck the [Docusaurus Argos page](https://app.argos-ci.com/meta-open-source/docusaurus) to explore our own website reports.\\n\\nHere is a more concrete example of Argos [reporting a visual regression](https://app.argos-ci.com/slorber/rnw-visual-tests/builds/32/56012838) found while upgrading the React-Native website:\\n\\n[![Argos GitHub PR comment](./img/argos-react-native-regression.png)](https://app.argos-ci.com/slorber/rnw-visual-tests/builds/32/56012838)\\n\\n## Workflow implementation\\n\\nThis section will describe the implementation details of each step of the workflow.\\n\\nYou will need to [sign up to Argos](https://app.argos-ci.com/signup) and [connect Argos to your GitHub repository](https://argos-ci.com/docs/github)\\n\\n### Dependencies\\n\\nThis workflow requires the following dev dependencies, in addition to the usual Docusaurus ones:\\n\\n```bash\\nyarn add -D @argos-ci/cli @argos-ci/playwright @playwright/test cheerio\\n```\\n\\n### GitHub Action\\n\\nThe GitHub action is responsible for executing the workflow for each Git branch.\\n\\nA minimal workflow could look like:\\n\\n```yaml title=\\".github/workflows/argos.yml\\"\\nname: Argos CI Screenshots\\n\\non:\\n  push:\\n    branches: [main]\\n  pull_request:\\n    branches: [main]\\n\\njobs:\\n  take-screenshots:\\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\\n    steps:\\n      -

You will probably need to add new CSS rules to this base stylesheet, according to flaky elements found on your own site. Read [Argos - About flaky tests docs](https://argos-ci.com/docs/about-flaky) for details.\\n\\n```css title=\\"screenshot.css\\"\\n/* Iframes can load lazily */\\niframe,\\n/* Avatars can be flaky due to using external sources: GitHub/Unavatar */\\n.avatar__photo,\\n/* Gifs load lazily and are animated */\\nimg[src$=\'.gif\'],\\n/* Algolia keyboard shortcuts appear with a little delay */\\n.DocSearch-Button-Keys > kbd,\\n/* The live playground preview can often display dates/counters */\\n[class*=\'playgroundPreview\'] {\\n  visibility: hidden;\\n}\\n\\n/* Different docs last-update dates can alter layout */\\n.theme-last-updated,\\n/* Mermaid diagrams are rendered client-side and produce layout shifts */\\n.docusaurus-mermaid-container {\\n  display: none;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n:::tip prevent layout shifts\\n\\nWe recommend hiding flaky UI elements affecting layout with `display: none;`.\\n\\nFor example, the docs \\"Last Updated on\\" might render on more than 1 line, eventually \\"pushing\\" the rest of your content further down, leading to Argos detecting many different pixels.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Example repository\\n\\nThe [slorber/docusaurus-argos-example](https://github.com/slorber/docusaurus-argos-example) repo shows a complete example of implementing this workflow on a newly initialized Docusaurus v2 site, using a Yarn monorepo.\\n\\n[![Docusaurus + Argos monorepo example screenshot](./img/docusaurus-argos-example-repo-screenshot.png)](https://github.com/slorber/docusaurus-argos-example)\\n\\nRelevant pull-requests:\\n\\n- [PR - Set up GitHub Action + Playwright + Argos](https://github.com/slorber/docusaurus-argos-example/pull/1): implements the minimal workflow described above\\n- [PR - Upgrading Docusaurus from v2 to v3](https://github.com/slorber/docusaurus-argos-example/pull/2): shows how Argos caught 3 visual regressions while upgrading\\n\\n:::tip More advanced example?\\n\\nBrowse the Docusaurus repository for a more advanced integration:\\n\\n- [GitHub Action](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/main/.github/workflows/argos.yml)\\n- [Playwright + Argos tests](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/argos)\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Make it cheap\\n\\nThe tools we choose are implementation details of this visual regression testing workflow.\\n\\nFor Docusaurus, we choose [Argos](https://argos-ci.com/): it works well for us, and offers [free](https://argos-ci.com/pricing) and [open source](https://argos-ci.com/docs/open-source) plans. However, you are free to adopt alternative tools.\\n\\nIn case you don\'t mind storing large screenshots in Git, you can also try the free, self-hosted [Playwright Visual Comparisons](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots) and browse visual differences with `npx playwright show-report`. However, we found using a dedicated external tool is more convenient.\\n\\nExternal tools can be expensive, but generally offer free plans with an ample quota of screenshots. You can reduce your screenshot consumption by implementing a few tricks below.\\n\\n### Limit the number of pathnames\\n\\nThe base setup involves taking a screenshot of every single pathname found in `sitemap.xml`. For large sites, that can lead to a lot of screenshots.\\n\\nYou can decide to filter the pathnames to only take screenshots of the most critical pages.\\n\\nFor the Docusaurus website, do not take screenshots for versioned docs pages:\\n\\n```ts title=\\"screenshot.spec.ts\\"\\n// highlight-start\\nfunction isVersionedDocsPathname(pathname: string): boolean {\\n  return pathname.match(/^\\\\/docs\\\\/((\\\\d\\\\.\\\\d\\\\.\\\\d)|(next))\\\\//);\\n}\\n// highlight-end\\n\\ntest.describe(\'Docusaurus site screenshots\', () => {\\n  const pathnames = extractSitemapPathnames(sitemapPath)\\n    // highlight-next-line\\n    .filter(isVersionedDocsPathname);\\n\\n  pathnames.forEach(screenshotPathname);\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### Limit the workflow concurrency\\n\\nImplementing [GitHub Actions concurrency groups](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency) will prevent successive commits to trigger multiple useless workflow runs. The workflow will only be executed for the last commit, and previous commits will be canceled automatically.\\n\\n```yaml title=\\".github/workflows/argos.yml\\"\\nconcurrency:\\n  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.head_ref || github.run_id }}\\n  cancel-in-progress: true\\n```\\n\\n### Run your workflow conditionally\\n\\nIt\'s not worth running this workflow for every single commit and pull-request.\\n\\nFor example, if someone corrects a typo in your documentation, you probably don\'t want to take hundreds of screenshots and have Argos to point out that only the modified page has a visual difference: duh, that\'s a bit expected!\\n\\nFor the Docusaurus website, we only run the workflow for pull-request having the `Argos` label:\\n\\n```yaml title=\\".github/workflows/argos.yml\\"\\nname: Argos CI Screenshots\\n\\non:\\n  push:\\n    branches: [main]\\n  pull_request:\\n    branches: [main]\\n    # highlight-start\\n    types:\\n      - opened\\n      - synchronize\\n      - reopened\\n      - labeled\\n    # highlight-end\\n\\njobs:\\n  take-screenshots:\\n    # highlight-start\\n    if: ${{ github.ref_name == \'main\' || (github.event_name == \'pull_request\' && contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, \'Argos\')) }}\\n    # highlight-end\\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\\n    steps:\\n      # Your job steps here ...\\n```\\n\\nThere are many options to explore, such as [triggering the workflow manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow) or [only when files matching a specific pattern are modified](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#example-including-paths).\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI believe **visual regression testing is underused** in the frontend ecosystem.\\n\\nTaking full-page screenshots is a **low-hanging fruit** that is easy to set up and can help you **catch a new class of bugs** that your regular test suite would miss. This technique shines not only for npm package upgrades, but also for **any kind of refactoring** that shouldn\'t change the user interface.\\n\\nSo why not give it a try?\\n\\nHappy hacking!\\n\\n## See also\\n\\nUseful documentation links:\\n\\n- [Playwright -

We had a lot of internal and open source projects to document. It\'s **complicated enough to write good documentation**, let alone to create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a good-looking website. We wanted project leaders to be able to **focus on the content**, and **Markdown** is great for that.\\n\\nAt that time, our solution was to **copy/paste a Jekyll template** over and over again. This naturally became **hard to maintain**, so we created a tool to **solve our own pain** once for all.\\n\\n**[Docusaurus v1 was born](/blog/2017/12-14-introducing-docusaurus.mdx)!**\\n\\n![Birth of Slash](/img/slash-birth.png)\\n\\nIt quickly built momentum at Facebook and in the frontend ecosystem, adopted by many popular projects such as [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [React-Native](https://archive.reactnative.dev/), [KaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/), and of course [Docusaurus v1](http://v1.docusaurus.io/) itself.\\n\\n<ShowcaseCarouselV1 />\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nNotice that the sample sites above use different colors, but still look quite the same.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Toward Docusaurus 2.0\\n\\n[**Docusaurus v1**](http://v1.docusaurus.io/) has been very successful, but we started to **question some architectural choices**:\\n\\n- React was only used as a **server-side templating language**, and not used on the client\\n- **Theming system was pretty limited**, and apart from changing a few colors with CSS, it was difficult to do more advanced customizations\\n- The **docs versioning system was confusing**, since it was based on a diff algorithm\\n- The codebase was **monolithic**, neither well-tested nor easy to extend\\n\\n[**Docusaurus v2**](https://docusaurus.io/) was **rebuilt** from the ground up with a new **modular architecture**:\\n\\n- React is now also used on the client, enabling a **modern Single Page Application navigation**\\n- **Plugins** empower the community to contribute useful features as third-party packages\\n- **Theming** is more **flexible** than ever\\n- Docs versioning is now based on snapshot copies, much easier to understand\\n- We kept **everything good from v1**: docs, blog, pages, versioning, i18n...\\n- We implemented **several new features**\\n\\nMore details in the [Docusaurus 2 project announcement](/blog/2018/09-11-Towards-Docusaurus-2.mdx) and [v1 to v2 migration guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/migration)\\n\\n## Who uses Docusaurus 2.0?\\n\\nDespite being in pre-release, it didn\'t take long for **Docusaurus v2 to outgrow Docusaurus v1** in terms of NPM downloads:\\n\\n[![NPM downloads: v2 outgrows v1](./img/npm-downloads.png)](https://npmtrends.com/docusaurus-vs-@docusaurus/core)\\n\\nOur GitHub star trend is very positive, competing with major frameworks:\\n\\n[![GitHub stars: Docusaurus is well-positioned](./img/star-history.png)](https://star-history.com/#facebook/docusaurus&vercel/next.js&gatsbyjs/gatsby&hexojs/hexo&nuxt/nuxt.js&vuejs/vuepress&11ty/eleventy&gohugoio/hugo&remix-run/remix&mkdocs/mkdocs&Timeline)\\n\\nToday, Docusaurus v2 has already been a great success even before its launch:\\n\\n- We received so many [lovely testimonials](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/timelines/1392048416872706049)\\n- Companies like [1Password](https://blog.1password.com/docusaurus-documentation-framework/) and [Courier](https://www.courier.com/blog/how-we-built-our-documentation/) are writing down their positive experience\\n- Our [site showcase](/showcase) references hundreds of sites, and this is only the tip of the iceberg.\\n\\n<ShowcaseCarouselV2 />\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nPlease add your site to our [site showcase](/showcase)!

We added file system conventions, and adding a doc page is as easy as creating one Markdown file.\\n\\n<LiteYouTubeEmbed\\n  id=\\"T3S8GyFIXjo\\"\\n  params=\\"autoplay=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0\\"\\n  title=\\"Explain Like I\'m 5: Docusaurus\\"\\n  poster=\\"maxresdefault\\"\\n  webp\\n/>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n<TweetQuote\\n  url=\\"https://twitter.com/paularmstrong/status/1552005085168865281\\"\\n  handle=\\"paularmstrong\\"\\n  name=\\"Paul Armstrong\\"\\n  job=\\"Principal Engineer at Microsoft\\">\\n  Using the auto-generated sidebars makes it so simple to just create a page and\\n  not worry about any other configuration.\\n</TweetQuote>\\n\\n### Plugins\\n\\nDocusaurus now has a **modular architecture** with a plugin system \u2014 our **core features** like docs, blog, pages, and search are all powered by individual plugins.\\n\\nMore importantly, it enables our community to **enhance Docusaurus** with additional features.\\n\\nLet\'s highlight some examples:\\n\\n- [redocusaurus](https://github.com/rohit-gohri/redocusaurus): seamless integration with [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) and [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc)\\n\\n![redocusaurus plugin example](./img/plugins/redocusaurus.png)\\n\\n- [docusaurus-preset-shiki-twoslash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docusaurus-preset-shiki-twoslash): use [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) code block syntax highlighting with [TwoSlash](https://shikijs.github.io/twoslash/) TypeScript compiler hints\\n\\n![shiki-twoslash plugin example](./img/plugins/shiki-twoslash.png)\\n\\n<TweetQuote\\n  url=\\"https://twitter.com/orta\\"\\n  handle=\\"orta\\"\\n  name=\\"Orta Therox\\"\\n  job=\\"Former TypeScript core team at Microsoft\\">\\n  The plugin API was a breeze to use, and powerful enough that I could port the\\n  code sample renderer from the TypeScript website site in a couple of hours.\\n</TweetQuote>\\n\\n- [docusaurus-search-local](https://github.com/easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local): one of the various local search alternatives to the built-in Algolia plugin\\n\\n![local search plugin example](./img/plugins/search.png)\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nWe have a curated list of outstanding plugins in our [community resources](/community/resources) page.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<TweetQuote\\n  url=\\"https://twitter.com/jodyheavener/status/1551974535452311552\\"\\n  handle=\\"jodyheavener\\"\\n  name=\\"Jody Heavener\\"\\n  job=\\"Senior Developer at 1Password\\">\\n  The plugin system in Docusaurus v2 has made expanding 1Password\'s developer\\n  portal so easy and fun. Super excited to show you what we\'ve got cooking up.\\n</TweetQuote>\\n\\n### Theming\\n\\nTheming is one of the most important features of Docusaurus: we believe a professional documentation site should **respect your company\'s branding** and create a consistent experience.\\n\\nDocusaurus theming gives a lot of **flexibility** on multiple levels:\\n\\n- Customize CSS variables to adjust colors, fonts, and more\\n- Provide your own CSS stylesheets\\n- Implement your own theme from scratch\\n- **Override any React component** provided by our default theme: we call this [swizzling](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling)\\n\\n<TweetQuote\\n  url=\\"https://twitter.com/hung_dev/status/1546918275065741312\\"\\n  handle=\\"hung_dev\\"\\n  name=\\"\\nHung Viet Nguyen\\"\\n  job=\\"Creator of JestPreview\\">\\n  I love Docusaurus Swizzling feature.

Super solid,\\n  a good bit of configuration without being overwhelming, and the ability to\\n  really customize the styling if you\'re braver than I am.\\n</TweetQuote>\\n\\n## Why 2.0 now?\\n\\nMany enthusiastic followers of ours have been curious **why it took us 4 years to release Docusaurus 2.0**, considering the beta is already successful and **widely used in production**.\\n\\nThe reason is that we aim to **respect [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)**, which means we will be incrementing the major version number whenever we release a **breaking change**.\\n\\nIt is important for multiple reasons:\\n\\n- It **guarantees simple minor version upgrades**, as long as you only use the [public API](/community/release-process#public-api-surface)\\n- It follows front-end ecosystem conventions\\n- A new major version is an opportunity to thoroughly document breaking changes\\n- A new major/minor version is an opportunity to communicate new features through a blog post\\n\\nThe problem is that our flexible theming system inherently creates a very **implicit API surface** on which it is **hard to know what is a breaking change** in the first place. Highly customized Docusaurus sites sometimes have a hard time upgrading Docusaurus because they achieve customizations using internal APIs. We dedicated time to extensive theme refactors and clearly defining our [public API](/community/release-process#public-api-surface), so that future code changes can be made more safely. We will continue to expand this public theming API so that the most common site customizations do not need to use any internal API.\\n\\n:::info\\n\\nFrom now on, Docusaurus will **release new major versions more frequently**. In practice, you can expect a **new major version every 2 to 4 months**.\\n\\n[Major version numbers are not sacred](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2022/05/23/major-version-numbers-are-not-sacred.html), but we still group breaking changes together and avoid releasing major versions too often.\\n\\nCheck our [release process](/community/release-process) documentation for details.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\n![Slash Up and Running](/img/slash-up-and-running.png)\\n\\nThe work on Docusaurus 3.0 has started, and this next version will be released only in a few months. We will **backport retro-compatible changes in Docusaurus 2.x** minor versions to make them available as soon as possible to the community on a stable channel.\\n\\nA sample of the features on our roadmap for the upcoming major versions of Docusaurus:\\n\\n- [Upgrade to MDX 2.0](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4029)\\n- [Improve Markdown infrastructure](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4625)\\n- [Improve theming and swizzle](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/6114)\\n- [TailwindCSS theme](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2961)\\n- [Theme; support custom item types for navbar, doc sidebar, blog sidebar, footer](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/7227)\\n- [Dynamic navbar: navbar item activation strategies](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4389)\\n- [Custom Social Cards](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2968)\\n- [CSS-in-JS support](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3236)\\n- [Use Node.js ES Modules](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/6520)\\n- [Improve build time performance](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4765)\\n- [Extend Docusaurus plugins, CMS integration](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4138)\\n\\n## Thank You\\n\\nWe\'d like to express our gratitude to [all our contributors](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/graphs/contributors), including:\\n\\n- The Docusaurus core team: [Alexey Pyltsyn](https://github.com/lex111), [Joshua Chen](https://github.com/Josh-Cena), [S\xe9bastien Lorber](https://github.com/slorber), [Yangshun Tay](https://github.com/yangshun) and all our [former team members](https://docusaurus.io/community/team)\\n- [Joel Marcey](https://github.com/JoelMarcey) for creating Docusaurus 1.0 and supporting the Docusaurus 2.0 project at Meta Open Source\\n- [Paul O\u2019Shannessy](https://github.com/zpao) for supporting the development of all the next versions of Docusaurus at Meta Open Source\\n- [Eric Nakagawa](https://github.com/ericnakagawa) for creating our cutest mascot Slash\\n- [Endilie Yacop Sucipto](https://github.com/endiliey) for his significant [initial work on Docusaurus v2](/blog/2020/01-07-tribute-to-endi.mdx)\\n- [Cl\xe9ment Vannicatte](https://github.com/shortcuts), [Kevin Granger](https://github.com/Shipow) and the whole Algolia team for their support\\n- All the community members for making valuable code contributions, improving our documentation, and answering questions on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus)\\n\\nWe\'d like to thank in particular all our **Docusaurus 2.0 early adopters** for assessing its alpha, beta and canary releases, providing a ton of **invaluable feedback**.

If your site uses Docusaurus, we would love to [have it in our showcase](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/edit/main/website/src/data/users.tsx).\\n\\n## Community\\n\\nAs an active moderator on [Discord](https://discord.gg/docusaurus), I can clearly see the community thriving. Many frequently asked questions are now integrated into our documentation, and some feature requests have been implemented as well. The project and the community reciprocally benefit each other \u2013 case in point, I was formerly a community contributor before becoming a maintainer.\\n\\nWe are constantly mentioned on Twitter with inspirational feedback:\\n\\n> **@docusaurus** is amazing! cant believe it\'s THAT simple to use.\\n\\n> No extra plugins, tooling or compilation steps. It just works out of the box.\\n\\n> I love **@docusaurus**. I couldn\'t have built the APIs, tutorials, and blogs contained in my site efficiently and beautifully in my workflow without Docusaurus.\\n\\nAnd we keep every one of them in [our little box](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/timelines/1392048416872706049) \ud83d\ude04 If you enjoy Docusaurus yourself, keep tagging us with your comments!\\n\\nAs we approach the official release, we are interested in knowing more about what people are doing out there: [plugin authors](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/discussions/4025), [creators of customized sites](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/discussions/5468), and [all new users](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/discussions/4610) \u2013 please keep us posted about your achievements so we can steer our development to better serve your needs.\\n\\n## Going forward\\n\\nIn the past few months, we have been constantly speaking about the release-candidate phase of Docusaurus, and yes, it\'s almost there. We have created a dedicated [milestone](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/milestone/15) to keep track of all issues to solve before we can confidently progress to the next stage. In short, we want to build a **more robust theming workflow**, empowering creative site creators to customize our default theme without fearing breaking changes as they upgrade. This will include:\\n\\n- Guidelines on **component organization**. We want the theme components to have the right granularity so when you want to customize a part of your site, there\'s always a component doing just what you need.\\n- Improvements to the **swizzle CLI**. We want users to use it with delight and let it aid you through all possible swizzling scenarios.\\n- Refactoring our **theme APIs**. We want all swizzlable components to be actually appropriate for swizzling, so non-UI components will be re-located.\\n- **Docs**. We want our docs to be maximally accessible to everyone \u2013 from first-time coders to experienced web developers. We will organize it as a more progressive tutorial that can be beneficial for every skill level.\\n\\nRead more about plans for Docusaurus 2.0 in this [roadmap issue](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/6113). 2.0 will be a greater release with the help from the community, so please share your opinions and suggestions under any of the milestone issues!\\n\\nAs the core team is working hard to ship the general availability release, we plan to release other useful features as minor versions after 2.0. We have even made further plans for [architectural changes in 3.0](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/milestone/16)!\\n\\nWith the official release of Docusaurus 2.0, we are confident to see much more new adoptions and migrations from v1.\\n\\nWe\'d like to express our gratitude to [all the contributors in 2021](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/graphs/contributors?from=2021-01-01&to=2022-01-01&type=c), including:\\n\\n- The core team: [Alexey Pyltsyn](https://github.com/lex111), [S\xe9bastien

blogs **for free**.\\n\\nYou can [read more here](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/what-is-docsearch/), and [apply](https://docsearch.algolia.com/apply) if you\'d like to give it a try!\\n\\n## What is this migration about?\\n\\n### Motivation\\n\\nWith the upcoming stable release of [DocSearch UI](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/DocSearch-v3), we wanted to go further and provide better tooling for our users to improve their search, but also leverage the full potential of Algolia.\\n\\n### What\'s new?\\n\\nDocSearch now leverages the [Algolia Crawler](https://www.algolia.com/products/search-and-discovery/crawler/), which includes a web interface that will allow you to:\\n\\n- Start, schedule and monitor your crawls\\n- Edit your config file from a live editor\\n- Test your results with DocSearch v3\\n\\n![The Algolia crawler front page showing the project\'s overview, such as last complete crawl and

The right pane shows the results for index and various facet filters.](./img/editor.png)\\n\\nBut also, more Algolia features in **your own Algolia app**:\\n\\n- Team management\\n- Browse and see how your records are indexed in Algolia\\n- Try other Algolia features with free trials\\n\\n![The Algolia index overview page, showing various filters and the details of every single index](./img/index-overview.png)\\n\\n![The Algolia index analytics page, showing trends for total users, total searches, etc.](./img/index-analytics.png)\\n\\nAnd of course, **a lot more, for free**.\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### I\'m using Docusaurus and DocSearch, can I migrate? {#im-using-docusaurus-and-docsearch-can-i-migrate}\\n\\nAt the time we are writing this, we are still at an early stage of the migration. We are doing small batches every week but will increase the load shortly, so please be patient and keep an eye out in your mailbox, you\'ll be contacted as soon as your Algolia app is ready!\\n\\n### Where can I read more about this?\\n\\nWe wrote a small [migration guide](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/migrating-from-legacy) but you\'ll have more detailed information in the migration email.\\n\\n### I received the migration email but the invite expired\\n\\nPlease contact us via either [email](mailto:docsearch@algolia.com) or [DocSearch\'s Discord](https://discord.gg/bRTacwYrfX) or on [Docusaurus\'s Discord #algolia channel](https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus)\\n\\n### I have feedback!\\n\\nFor any feedback regarding our documentation or the DocSearch UI component, you can open an issue [on our GitHub repository](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch/issues), but also contact us via the methods above.\\n\\n### Can I still run my own DocSearch instance?\\n\\nIn favor of the new infrastructure and DocSearch v3, we will no longer maintain our beloved [DocSearch scraper](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-scraper) and [DocSearch v2](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch/tree/master), but the repositories will still be available and open to pull requests.\\n\\nThe previous documentation (now called `legacy`) remains available as well as our [`run your own`](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/legacy/run-your-own) guide."},{"id":"/2021/05/12/announcing-docusaurus-two-beta","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/05/12/announcing-docusaurus-two-beta","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/edit/main/website/blog/2021/05-12-announcing-docusaurus-two-beta/index.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2021/05-12-announcing-docusaurus-two-beta/index.mdx","title":"Announcing Docusaurus 2 Beta","description":"After a lengthy alpha stage in order to ensure feature parity and quality, we are excited to officially release the first Docusaurus 2 beta.","date":"2021-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release","description":"Blog posts about Docusaurus\' new releases"},{"inline":false,"label":"Beta","permalink":"/blog/tags/beta"}],"readingTime":3.52,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"S\xe9bastien Lorber","title":"Docusaurus maintainer, This Week In React editor","url":"https://thisweekinreact.com","socials":{"x":"https://x.com/sebastienlorber","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastienlorber/","github":"https://github.com/slorber","newsletter":"https://thisweekinreact.com"},"imageURL":"./img/slorber.png","key":"slorber","image_url":"./img/slorber.png"},{"name":"Joel Marcey","title":"Developer Advocate at Meta","url":"https://twitter.com/JoelMarcey","email":"jimarcey@gmail.com","socials":{"x":"https://x.com/joelmarcey","github":"https://github.com/JoelMarcey"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/JoelMarcey.png","key":"JMarcey"},{"name":"Yangshun Tay","title":"Front End Engineer at Meta","url":"https://github.com/yangshun","email":"tay.yang.shun@gmail.com","socials":{"x":"https://x.com/yangshunz","github":"https://github.com/yangshun"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/yangshun.png","key":"yangshun"},{"name":"Alexey Pyltsyn","title":"Open-source enthusiast","url":"https://github.com/lex111","email":"lex@php.net","imageURL":"https://github.com/lex111.png","key":"lex111"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Announcing Docusaurus 2 Beta","authors":[{"key":"slorber","image_url":"./img/slorber.png","imageURL":"./img/slorber.png"},"JMarcey","yangshun","lex111"],"tags":["release","beta"],"image":"./img/social-card.png"},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1721402008000,"lastUpdatedBy":"S\xe9bastien Lorber","prevItem":{"title":"DocSearch migration","permalink":"/blog/2021/11/21/algolia-docsearch-migration"},"nextItem":{"title":"Releasing Docusaurus i18n","permalink":"/blog/2021/03/09/releasing-docusaurus-i18n"}},"content":"After a lengthy alpha stage in order to ensure feature parity and quality, we are excited to officially release the first **[Docusaurus 2 beta](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.0)**.\\n\\nWith the announcement of this beta, the team is even more confident that Docusaurus 2 is **ready for mainstream adoption**!\\n\\n![](./img/image_cropped.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Docusaurus adoption\\n\\n**Don\'t fear the beta tag!**\\n\\nDocusaurus 2 is widely adopted and growing fast:\\n\\n[![Docusaurus v1 vs. v2 npm trends from 2019 to mid 2021. The installations of Docusaurus v2 is sharply rising, while v1 is mostly stable. V1 fluctuates between 10000 and 20000, while v2 starts at 0 and ends at almost 60000. The intersection happens around June 2020.](./img/trend.png)](https://www.npmtrends.com/docusaurus-vs-@docusaurus/core)\\n\\nTo get a fuller understanding of the quality of current Docusaurus 2 sites, our new [showcase](https://docusaurus.io/showcase) page allows you to filter Docusaurus sites by features, so you may get inspired by real-world production sites with a similar use-case as yours!\\n\\nDon\'t miss our [favorite](https://docusaurus.io/showcase?tags=favorite) sites; they all stand out with something unique:\\n\\n[![A screenshot of the showcase\'s favorites section, with 12 cards each displaying the information and preview of one site](./img/favorites.png)](https://docusaurus.io/showcase?tags=favorite)\\n\\n## Why was Docusaurus v2 in alpha for so long?\\n\\nIt\'s hard to believe that the first alpha release [v2.0.0-alpha.0](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.0) was 2 years ago \ud83d\ude33 , unusually long for a software alpha.\\n\\nAs this was a substantial re-architecture of the code base, we wanted to ensure that we had confidence in the stability and features of Docusaurus 2 before moving on to a beta stage, since beta suggests a high level of quality. We are happy to say that Docusaurus 2 has reached **feature parity** with Docusaurus 1 with **[i18n](https://docusaurus.io/blog/2021/03/09/releasing-docusaurus-i18n)**, and it has been **successfully adopted** by many Docusaurus sites (see [i18n showcase](https://docusaurus.io/showcase?tags=i18n)).\\n\\nWe\'re now quite confident that the core features of Docusaurus 2 are stable enough to be in beta.\\n\\n## What are the goals of the beta?\\n\\nNow that Docusaurus 2 is stable and major feature complete, the goal of the beta is to inspire confidence in new users on the production-readiness of Docusaurus 2, migrate more remaining Docusaurus 1 users to version 2, and officially deprecate Docusaurus 1. We will, of course, continue to resolve any issues and bugs that may be discovered.\\n\\nIn addition, we will use the beta phase to **improve our theming system**.\\n\\nWe want to make it:\\n\\n- **easier to implement a custom theme**, including for ourselves. We want to provide [multiple official themes](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3522) (including [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2961)) for a long time.\\n\\n- **safer to extend an existing theme**: it can be painful to upgrade a highly customized Docusaurus site, as customizations can conflict with internal changes. We need to make the theme public API surface more explicit, and make it clear what is safe to customize.\\n\\nWe will build a better **theming infrastructure** and refactor the classic theme to use it.\\n\\nIf you customize your site, you may find these planned improvements quite valuable.\\n\\n## What\'s new?\\n\\nIn case you missed it, we recently shipped two major improvements:\\n\\n- [Auto-generated sidebars](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar#sidebar-item-autogenerated): no need to maintain a `sidebars.js` file anymore!\\n- [Webpack 5 / PostCSS 8](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4027): persistent caching significantly speeds up **rebuild time**!\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nShipping the official 2.0 release!\\n\\nTo get there, we will continue to **fix bugs** and implement the **most wanted features**, including:\\n\\n- [Sidebar category index pages](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2643)\\n- [Better mobile navigation UX](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2220)\\n- [Better admonition design](https://github.com/facebookincubator/infima/issues/55)\\n- [CSS-in-JS support](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3236)\\n- [Improve build time performance](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4765)\\n- [Extend Docusaurus plugins, CMS integration](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4138)\\n- [Fix trailing slashes and relative link issues](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3372)\\n- [Better compatibility with CommonMark](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3018)\\n- [Upgrade to MDX 2.0](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4029)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThis is an exciting time for Docusaurus.\\n\\nWe are inspired by the [positive feedback](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/timelines/1392048416872706049) about Docusaurus, and discover new sites online every single day.\\n\\nWe are so excited for this beta release. We strove for quality and stability while continuing to try to increase the adoption of Docusaurus. For those that have been on the fence from migrating an existing Docusaurus site to Docusaurus 2, it is a great time to upgrade. We want you running on the latest infrastructure when we deprecate Docusaurus 1 at the end of this beta period. Let us know how we can help.\\n\\nThank you to everyone for reading and to the entire community who supports Docusaurus.

([internationalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization)), as part of [2.0.0-alpha.71](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.71).\\n\\nDocusaurus 2 has now reached **full feature parity with Docusaurus 1**. \ud83c\udf89 And soon, after a few additional infrastructure updates and a bit more testing, the **first Docusaurus 2 beta** will be released.\\n\\n**We went the extra mile**, and the new i18n support is **even better than in Docusaurus 1**.\\n\\nIn this post, we will present you the **translation workflow**, explain some **design decisions** and **showcase early adopter sites** that just went live: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Redwood](https://learn.redwoodjs.com/), and [Datagit](https://datagit.ir/).\\n\\nWe also **dogfood** the i18n support on the **Docusaurus 2 site itself**, and this post is already available in [English](https://docusaurus.io/blog/2021/03/09/releasing-docusaurus-i18n) and [French](https://docusaurus.io/fr/blog/2021/03/09/releasing-docusaurus-i18n)!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Translate your site\\n\\nYou can translate a Docusaurus site in **3 simple steps**:\\n\\n1. **Configure**: declare the default locale and alternative locales in `docusaurus.config.js`\\n1. **Translate**: put the translation files at the [correct filesystem location](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/i18n/introduction#translation-files-location)\\n1. **Deploy**: build and deploy your site using a single or multi-domain strategy\\n\\nThe i18n support is **very flexible** and based on the **filesystem**.\\n\\nThe **[i18n tutorial](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/tutorial)** is the best way to get started, and we provide help to use **[Git](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/git)** or **[Crowdin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/crowdin)**.\\n\\n## Design decisions\\n\\nThe goals of the Docusaurus i18n system are:\\n\\n- **Simple**: just put the translated files in the [correct filesystem location](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/i18n/introduction#translation-files-location)\\n- **Flexible translation workflows**: use Git (monorepo, forks, or submodules), SaaS software, FTP\\n- **Flexible deployment options**: single, multiple domains, or hybrid\\n- **Modular**: allow plugin authors to provide i18n support\\n- **Low-overhead runtime**: documentation is mostly static and does not require a heavy JS library or polyfills\\n- **Scalable build-times**: allow building and deploying localized sites independently\\n- **Localize assets**: an image of your site might contain text that should be translated\\n- **No coupling**: not forced to use any SaaS, yet integrations are possible\\n- **Easy to use with [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/)**: multiple Docusaurus 1 sites use Crowdin, and should be able to migrate to v2\\n- **Good SEO defaults**: we set useful SEO headers like [`hreflang`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/localized-versions) for you\\n- **RTL support**: locales reading right-to-left (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.) are supported and easy to implement\\n- **Default translations**: classic theme labels are translated for you in [many languages](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/docusaurus-theme-translations/locales)\\n\\n## Showcase\\n\\nWe worked with a few volunteers to **dogfood the i18n support** before releasing it.\\n\\n### Jest: upgrading Docusaurus\\n\\nWe have made it possible to **upgrade** a **translated Docusaurus 1 site** to Docusaurus 2.\\n\\n**[Jest](https://jestjs.io)**, using Docusaurus 1 and Crowdin was one of those sites.\\n\\nThe Docusaurus 2 migration was successful and the new site is now deployed in production ([announcement post](https://jestjs.io/blog/2021/03/09/jest-website-upgrade)).\\n\\n[![Jest\'s website front page in Japanese](/img/blog/2021-03-09-releasing-docusaurus-i18n/jest.png)](https://jestjs.io)\\n\\n### Redwood: adopting Docusaurus\\n\\n[Redwood](https://redwoodjs.com/) is a React full-stack Jamstack framework.\\n\\nThey were looking for a solution to create an **internationalized learning platform**, and became early adopters of Docusaurus 2 i18n for [learn.redwoodjs.com](https://learn.redwoodjs.com/), using Crowdin to get it translated to French.\\n\\n[![Redwood\'s doc page in French](/img/blog/2021-03-09-releasing-docusaurus-i18n/redwood.png)](https://learn.redwoodjs.com/)\\n\\n### Datagit: using LTR support\\n\\nThe i18n system should work with any language, including **Right-to-Left languages**.\\n\\n[Datagit.ir](https://datagit.ir/) is using Farsi, and a simple configuration option is able to **flip the Docusaurus theme** to add the required Right-to-Left

Otherwise we will work with you to make that happen in 2020 :)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Docusaurus 2 (D2)\\n\\nIn 2018, we proposed to rebuild [Docusaurus from the ground up](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/789). It involved a major rearchitecture effort - we created a content-centric CSS framework from scratch, a plugins system, and moved from static HTML pages to be a single page-app with prerendered routes. It was a wild adventure and a tough feat, especially with no dedicated FTE working on the project. With the help of [@endilie](https://github.com/endiliey), our ex-intern-turned-contributor-turned-maintainer, we made really good progress on D2 and are currently on version 2.0.0-alpha.40. All features in Docusaurus 1 except for translations have been ported over.\\n\\nD2\'s killer features are **Dark Mode** and its **superb performance**. D2 has dark mode support out-of-the-box and it is near effortless to create a dark mode-friendly documentation site. Endilie put in great effort into optimizing the performance of the site and a bunch of performance optimization tricks have been done under the hood by default - optimized images, prerendering every route to static HTML and client-side routing thereafter, prefetching assets needed by future navigations whenever the user hovers over a navigation link, etc.\\n\\nLast but not least, we implemented a plugins architecture and turned the repo into a [Lerna monorepo](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages). We believe this plugin architecture will be helpful towards building a community and also allowing users to build their own features for their unique use cases.\\n\\n## GitHub Activity\\n\\n- Stars: 10050 \u2192 14632 (+45.6% y/y)\\n- Total Contributors: 182 \u2192 303 (+66.4% y/y). Most of which are non-Facebook contributors\\n- Daily npm Downloads: 728 \u2192 2320 (+218.7% y/y). The peak was in November\\n- D1 is currently used by 3872 projects on GitHub while D2 is used by 247 projects on GitHub\\n- We now have 4 active core contributors! (+100% y/y)\\n\\n## Notable Users\\n\\nA good portion of the projects within the Open Source community use Docusaurus.

In 2020, we want to achieve full feature parity with D1 by the first half and help the remaining Facebook projects on D1 move to D2. It would also be great if we could use Docusaurus for internal documentation, but that is a non-trivial undertaking. If you have a need for it or have some ideas, come speak with us!\\n\\nHuge thanks to the community for their contributions, especially the core team - [Endilie Yacop Sucipto](https://github.com/endiliey), [Alexey Pyltsyn](https://github.com/lex111), [Wei Gao](https://github.com/wgao19).

In the current static site generators ecosystem, t...\\n</blockquote>\\n\\nMost of the suggested improvements are mentioned in the issue; I will provide details on some of issues in Docusaurus 1 and how we are going to address them in Docusaurus 2.\\n\\n## Infrastructure\\n\\n### Content\\n\\nA Docusaurus 1 website is, in fact, built into a bunch of static HTML pages. Despite using React, we were not fully utilizing the features React offered, such as component state, which allows for dynamic and interactive pages. React was only used as a templating engine for static content and interactivity has to be added through script tags and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` \ud83d\ude31.\\n\\nIn addition, there is not an easy way to change how Docusaurus loads content. For example, adding CSS preprocessors such as Sass and Less was not supported natively and involved many user hacks of adding custom scripts.\\n\\nFor Docusaurus 2, we will be using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as a module bundler and we are changing the way we serve content. Adding CSS preprocessors will be as easy as adding a webpack loader. Instead of a pure static HTML, **during build time we will create a server-rendered version of the app** and render the corresponding HTML. A Docusaurus site will be essentially an isomorphic/universal application. This approach is heavily inspired by [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby).\\n\\n### Versioning\\n\\nIf you have been using Docusaurus for a while, you might notice that Docusaurus creates versioned docs **if and only if** the docs content are **different**.\\n\\nFor example, if we have `docs/hello.md`:\\n\\n```text\\n---\\nid: hello\\ntitle: hello\\n---\\nHello world !\\n```\\n\\nAnd **we cut version 1.0.0,** Docusaurus will create `versioned_docs/version-1.0.0/hello.md`:\\n\\n```text\\n---\\nid: version-1.0.0-hello\\ntitle: hello\\noriginal_id: hello\\n---\\nHello world !\\n```\\n\\nHowever, if there are no changes to `hello.md` when cutting v2.0.0, Docusaurus will not create any versioned docs for that document. In other words, `versioned_docs/version-2.0.0/hello.md` will not exist.\\n\\nThis can be very confusing for users; if they want to edit the v2.0.0 docs, they have to edit `versioned_docs/version-1.0.0/hello.md` or manually add `versioned_docs/version-2.0.0/hello.md`. This could potentially lead to unwanted bugs. Here is a [real scenario in Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/6758#issuecomment-408274413).\\n\\nIn addition, this adds complexity within the codebase as we require a mechanism for version fallbacks. And during build time, Docusaurus has to replace the linking to the correct version. This is also the cause of a bug where [renaming docs breaks links in old versions](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/845).\\n\\nFor Docusaurus 2, **every time we cut a new version, we will instead take a snapshot of all the docs**. We will not require the content of a document to have changed. This is a space complexity trade-off for a better developer and user experience. We will use more space for better separation of concerns and guaranteed correctness.\\n\\n### Translation\\n\\nDocusaurus allows for easy translation functionality by using [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/). Documentation files written in English are uploaded to Crowdin for translation by users within a community. We always assumed that **English** is the default language, but this might not be the case for all users. We have seen plenty of non-English open source projects using Docusaurus.\\n\\nFor Docusaurus 2, **we will not assume English is the default language**. When a user enables internationalization, they have to set a default language in `siteConfig.js`. We will then assume that all the files in `docs` are written in that language.\\n\\nIn addition, after working on the MVP of Docusaurus 2, I realized that it is possible not to use Crowdin for translations. Thus, we might need to add an additional workflow to enable that scenario. However, we will still strongly recommend people use Crowdin for easier integration.\\n\\n## Customizability\\n\\n### Layout\\n\\nThe current state of Docusaurus is that it is in charge of the entire layout and styling, unintentionally making it very hard for users to customize their site\'s appearance to their wishes.\\n\\nFor Docusaurus 2, **layout and styling should be controlled by the user**. Docusaurus will handle the content generation, routing, translation, and versioning. Inspired by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), Docusaurus will still provide a default theme, which the user can eject from, for further layout and styling customization. This means that it is very possible for the user to even change the HTML meta by using [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet). Community-based themes are also very possible. This approach of allowing users to be in charge of layout and styling is taken by most static site generators.\\n\\n### Markdown\\n\\nOur Markdown parsing is currently powered by [Remarkable](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable). What if the user wants to use [Markdown-it](https://github.com/Markdown-it/Markdown-it) or even [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx)? And then there is an issue of which syntax highlighter to use, (e.g: [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) vs [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)). We should leave these choices open to the user.\\n\\nFor Docusaurus 2, **users can eject and choose their own Markdown parser**. It does not matter if they want to use another Markdown parser such as [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark), or even their own in-house Markdown parser. As a rule of thumb, the user has to provide a React component, in which we will provide a children props containing the _RAW string of Markdown_. By default, we will use Remarkable for the Markdown parser and Highlight.js for the syntax highlighting. The default parser could still change in the future as we\'re still experimenting with different Markdown parsers.\\n\\n### Search\\n\\nOur core search functionality is based on [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/). There are requests by users to be able to use different search offerings, such as `lunrjs` for offline search.\\n\\nI personally like Algolia and we have a great experience working with them. They are very responsive; we can easily submit a pull request to Algolia since their `DocSearch` is open source. For example, I recently submitted [this PR that enables DocSearch to scrape alternate languages in sitemap](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-scraper/pull/387).\\n\\nFor Docusaurus 2, **we will allow users to customize the search box**. Users simply need to eject from the default theme and modify the Search UI (a React component). However, we will still use Algolia in the default theme.\\n\\n## Stability\\n\\nSoftware is never going to be perfect, but we want Docusaurus to not break as we add new features. When Docusaurus was first released, it did not have any strong automated test suites. As a result, there were a lot of regressions not caught early. Although we have recently added a lot of tests, the test coverage is still relatively low.\\n\\nFor Docusaurus 2, **we are adding tests as we develop** since we are going for a fresh rewrite. Hence, I believe that it should be more stable than ever and it should be harder to break things compared to Docusaurus 1.\\n\\n## Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\n### Will there be any breaking changes?\\n\\nIf you\'ve read the post up until to this point, you should be able to notice that there will be breaking changes. While we will try to **minimize the number of breaking changes** and make it backward compatible as much as possible, we believe that some breaking changes are required. This is mostly due to Docusaurus 2 being a **major rewrite and re-architecting** of the codebase.\\n\\nThe exact list of breaking changes is not totally known yet as development is not 100% finalized. However, one thing that I will highlight is that we will deprecate a lot of options in `siteConfig.js` and we plan to keep it as lean as possible. For example, the `cleanUrl` siteConfig will be deprecated as all the URL for Docusaurus 2 sites will be without the `.html` suffix.\\n\\nOur goal is that most sites should be able to upgrade to Docusaurus 2 without a lot of pain. We will also include a migration guide when we release Docusaurus 2. When the times come, feel free to ping us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/docusaurus) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/docusaurus) for questions and help.\\n\\n### When is the release of Docusaurus 2?\\n\\nAs of now, we do not have an exact date planned for the release. I personally estimate that we might be able to release an alpha version in the next one to two months, but this is, of course, just an estimate.\\n\\nOne thing that I would like to share is that while Docusaurus is part of [Facebook Open Source](https://opensource.fb.com/) and most of the team are Facebook employees, the maintenance and development work is mostly done outside of normal working hours. I am currently a final year undergraduate student at [NTU Singapore](https://twitter.com/NTUsg), so I had to juggle between doing my coursework, my final year project and maintaining/developing Docusaurus. However, that does not mean that we do not want to make Docusaurus better. In fact, **we want to make it as awesome as possible**.\\n\\nFor now, the actual Docusaurus 2 work is still hosted in a private repository. In the near future, we will move them into the [public repository](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus). When that time arrives, I encourage everyone to look into it and hopefully contribute in some way. Before then, please stay tuned \ud83d\ude09!\\n\\n## Final Thoughts\\n\\nDocusaurus has had a large impact on the open source community as seen from the [many popular projects](https://v1.docusaurus.io/en/users) which use Docusaurus for documentation. In order to move faster in the future, we are taking the opportunity to fix some core problems with Docusaurus 1 and striving to make Docusaurus better for everyone. In fact, it is safe to say that Docusaurus 2 is not just a plan any longer; the work on it has started and, hopefully, we will be able to see it materialize in the near future.\\n\\nDocusaurus\' mission has always been to make it really easy for you to get a website with documentation up and running out of the box. That mission does not change with Docusaurus 2.\\n\\nWe also want to let people know that **due to work on Docusaurus 2, we will be less likely to accept new features/major changes on Docusaurus 1.**\\n\\nIf you are using Docusaurus, you are part of our community; keep letting us know how we can make Docusaurus better for you.

Your workflow for adding docs wouldn\'t be much different from editing those Markdown files.\u201d_\\n>\\n> _\u2014 Note sent to the Profilo team_\\n\\nThis is the story of the rather short journey it took to create the [Profilo](https://facebookincubator.github.io/profilo/) website using Docusaurus.\\n\\nProfilo, an Android library for collecting performance traces from production, [was announced](https://code.fb.com/android/profilo-understanding-app-performance-in-the-wild/) earlier this year. The project was [published on GitHub](https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/tree/802042f90f990998a272387e371b893af52465b8) with a less than [a handful or Markdown files](https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/tree/802042f90f990998a272387e371b893af52465b8/docs) to describe its functionality and no website to showcase any branding and highlight the logo. The task at hand was to turn these existing docs and logo into a website.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nIn general, when creating a website with Docusaurus you do the following:\\n\\n1. Generate a template website using Docusaurus scripts.\\n1. Customize the generated template files for your desired site colors and your project configuration (ex: website and GitHub links).\\n1. Create the website content:\\n   1. Add your docs and any supporting assets.\\n   1. Customize the default landing page provided by Docusaurus to suit your needs.\\n   1. Configure the default site navigation file.\\n1. Publish the website and set up how it will be published for future changes.\\n\\nGiven I had pre-existing Markdown files, I didn\'t have to generate the core content but simply make sure that Docusaurus could process the files by adding the expected metadata to them. Most of the work would therefore consist of customizing the defaults provided by Docusaurus.\\n\\n## Overview of Steps Taken\\n\\nHere\'s an overview of the steps taken to convert to a website. I\'ll discuss some of the design aspects in a later section.\\n\\n**Design and colors:**\\n\\n1. Got all the desired logo formats from designer. I had to create the _.favicon_ one.\\n1. Worked out some passable primary and secondary website colors using the http://paletton.com/ tools - very handy!\\n\\n**Initial website setup:**\\n\\n1. Forked the [Profilo project](https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/) on GitHub and created a local clone of the fork to set up the website.\\n1. Created the initial Docusaurus website using the [installation instructions](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation.html).\\n1. Deleted the `docs-examples-from-docusaurus` and `website/blog-examples-from-docusaurus` folders as these would not be needed. Profilo had existing docs we could use and there was no need for blogs at this time.\\n\\n**Content creation:**\\n\\n1. Added metadata to the existing Markdown files found in the `docs` folder, for example:\\n\\n   ```md\\n   ---\\n   id: architecture\\n   title: Architecture\\n   sidebar_label: Architecture\\n   ---\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Added the logo assets to the `website/static/img` folder.\\n3. Modified `website/pages/en/index.js`, the landing page, to highlight Profilo features.\\n4. Modified `website/core/Footer.js`, the footer, to simplify it for Profilo.\\n5. Edited `website/siteConfig.js` (website configuration file) to specify the previously chosen primary and secondary colors.\\n6. Modified `website/sidebars.json` that specifies the sidebar navigation. Listed all the docs and customized it based on the metadata added to the Markdown files.\\n7. Edited the website configuration file to specify the GitHub properties, logo images, header links, and the website link.\\n8. Tested the website locally throughout this phase. (I ran `yarn start` from the `website` folder to start the server.)\\n\\n**Feedback and review changes:**\\n\\n1. Sent a [pull request](https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/pull/6) to the project.\\n2. Updated the colors after the designer rightly gasped at the ones I had chosen (IANAD).\\n3. Updated the colors and updated the PR.\\n4. The PR was then accepted and [merged](https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/commit/6ad033aaf5a7d54e6d842f45a5bccd051a8e45ad). Yay!\\n\\n**Website publishing:**\\n\\n1. Pushed the first website version by running the Docusaurus publish script from the command line:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   USE_SSH=true \\\\\\n     GIT_USER=caabernathy \\\\\\n     CURRENT_BRANCH=master \\\\\\n     yarn run publish-gh-pages\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Configured CircleCI using the [provided Docusaurus instructions](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/publishing.html#automating-deployments-using-continuous-integration). There were 2 PRs for this, [the first](https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/pull/8)for the initial config and [the second](https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/pull/12) to make sure CircleCI only triggered for changes in the master branch (thanks Joel Marcey!).\\n\\nThe final website was published on https://facebookincubator.github.io/profilo/. It had taken 1.5 hours to get to the initial PR stage and another half an hour or so to respond to review feedback and publish the website.\\n\\n## Design\\n\\nHere\'s what the initial website looked like when the first pull request was sent out:\\n\\n![The website\'s front page, with a quite bright and saturated red color as the primary color, closely resembling the Profilo logo color, making the logo unrecognizable in the navbar](/img/profilo_blog_post_website_initial.png)\\n\\nMost of the time in the content creation was spent picking colors that worked reasonably well with the given logo. These colors were a good jumping off point for designer feedback. I used Photoshop to sample various portions of the logo.\\n\\n![Picking colors in Photoshop, with the Profilo logo and the main working area in the background and a color picker dialog in the foreground, selected to a red shade](/img/profilo_blog_post_photoshop_color_picker.png)\\n\\nI then took the RGB representation of the color and set it as the baseline color on [Paletton](http://paletton.com/). The website then gave me various color options to try on the website by editing the Docusaurus website configuration file.\\n\\n![Using Paletton to generate a full palette from the red shade selected. There\'s a color wheel showing all hues on the left, and a square showing various shades of red on the right.](/img/profilo_blog_post_palette_website_color_picker.png)\\n\\nThe selected primary and secondary colors were a good jumping off point for designer feedback.\\n\\nThere were also modifications made to the default website generated by Docusaurus. These changes were mainly around simplifying the footer and creating a customized landing page for Profilo that listed the project\'s features.\\n\\nHere\'s what the final website looked like:\\n\\n![The website\'s front page, with a much darker red color as the primary color, making both the logo and the primary-colored title text clearly legible.](/img/profilo_blog_post_website_final.png)\\n\\nThis is an example page showing the core content, in this case the Getting Started page:\\n\\n![A doc page with the sidebar on the left quarter of the screen and the main content occupying the rest. Some text is using the primary color and the main body uses multiple kinds of typesetting including bold, list, and code](/img/profilo_blog_post_website_final_docs.png)\\n\\nThis also shows the sidebar structure that was set up through editing `website/sidebars.json`.\\n\\nLastly, I didn\'t have to worry about handling responsive design. You get this out of the box with Docusaurus!\\n\\n![Mobile screenshots of the front page and sample doc page. The layout is automatically adjusted to make it appear more natural. The doc sidebar is hidden behind a button.](/img/profilo_blog_post_android_ios.png)\\n\\n## Final Thoughts\\n\\nThe Profilo engineers were happy to see that they didn\'t have to change their workflow to update existing content. They were able to continue working with Markdown files. This will still be true in the future if new docs are added, although there may be some config changes needed if the sidebar navigation needs to be updated.\\n\\nThe infrastructure provided by Docusaurus made it easy to convert Markdown files into a working website. Even though the project had only three docs, this gave Profilo a more professional look. So, it was well worth the short time investment to get it done."},{"id":"/2017/12/14/introducing-docusaurus","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2017/12/14/introducing-docusaurus","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/edit/main/website/blog/2017/12-14-introducing-docusaurus.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2017/12-14-introducing-docusaurus.mdx","title":"Introducing Docusaurus","description":"We are very happy to introduce Docusaurus to help you manage one or many open source websites.","date":"2017-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Documentation","permalink":"/blog/tags/documentation"},{"inline":false,"label":"Blog","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog"},{"inline":false,"label":"Docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":8.215,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Joel Marcey","title":"Developer Advocate at Meta","url":"https://twitter.com/JoelMarcey","email":"jimarcey@gmail.com","socials":{"x":"https://x.com/joelmarcey","github":"https://github.com/JoelMarcey"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/JoelMarcey.png","key":"JMarcey"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Introducing Docusaurus","authors":"JMarcey","tags":["documentation","blog","docusaurus"]},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1721402008000,"lastUpdatedBy":"S\xe9bastien Lorber","prevItem":{"title":"How I Converted Profilo to Docusaurus in Under 2 Hours","permalink":"/blog/2018/04/30/How-I-Converted-Profilo-To-Docusaurus"}},"content":"![](/img/slash-introducing.svg)\\n\\nWe are very happy to introduce [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) to help you manage one or many open source websites.\\n\\nWe created [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) for the following reasons:\\n\\n1. To put the focus on writing good documentation instead of worrying about the infrastructure of a website.\\n1. To provide features that many of our open source websites need like blog support, search and versioning.\\n1. To make it easy to push updates, new features, and bug fixes to everyone all at once.\\n1. And, finally, to provide a consistent look and feel across all of our open source projects.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nDocusaurus is a tool designed to make it easy for teams to publish documentation websites without having to worry about the infrastructure and design details. At its core, all a user has to provide are documentation files written in Markdown, customization of a provided home page written in React, and a few configuration modifications. Docusaurus handles the rest by providing default styles, site formatting, and simple document navigation. Getting started is easy, as users can [install](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation.html) it using `npm` or `yarn` via a simple initialization script that [creates a working example website out of the box](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/site-preparation.html).\\n\\nDocusaurus also provides core website and documentation features out-of-the-box including [blog support](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/blog.html), [internationalization](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/translation.html), [search](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/search.html), and [versioning](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/versioning.html). While some projects may not require any of these features, enabling them is generally a matter of updating configuration options instead of having to add the infrastructure from the ground up. As more features get added to Docusaurus, users just can easily update to the latest version. This can be done by simply running npm or yarn update and updating configuration options. Users or teams will no longer need to manually rework their entire website infrastructure each time a new feature gets added.\\n\\n## The Birth of docusaurus\\n\\n![](/img/slash-birth.png)\\n\\nWhen Facebook first started their open source program, many teams implemented a custom website for each of their open source projects. This approach presented challenges when the open source program team was asked to help the project teams improve their documentation. Since each site was unique, adding basic infrastructure such as a blog, consistent navigation, search, etc. became challenging undertakings.\\n\\nThe open source team tried to help mitigate this problem by coming up with a standard template, based on Jekyll, that could be used as a starting point for a project website. We asked our new projects to manually copy our template source to their repo, write their docs, and publish. This template approach was adopted by most of open source projects launched; some existing projects even converted their custom website implementations to the new template as well.\\n\\nThe problem with the \\"copy the template to your repo\\" approach is that, even though the platform is consistent, pushing updates becomes unmaintainable across an entire suite of projects already using the template. This is because we lost control of the template after a project copied it to their repo. Projects were free to modify the template as desired and apply their own project-specific features to it. So while projects share the same site generation platform, they have now diverted enough where they cannot take advantage of the new features we have added to the template over time. There was no easy way we could ask all current projects to \\"copy\\" a new version of the template since it might break their existing site or remove features that they have added on their own. Instead, we would have to apply the updates manually to each project one-by-one. This became very problematic when projects started asking for our team for internationalization support within the template, requiring low-level changes to how the template was structured and generated.\\n\\nSo we started thinking about what we could do to help mitigate the challenge of keeping sites updated and consistent across our entire portfolio. We also wanted multiple projects to share the same site generation software. We wanted them to start out with the same template, and yet have the flexibility to customize and adapt their site theme to suit their needs. They should be able to extend and customize their site, but when we update the underlying infrastructure with fixes and features, the project should be able update simply and without any breaking changes.\\n\\nDocusaurus was born!\\n\\nAt Facebook, Docusaurus allows us to quickly get different projects up and running with documentation websites, especially for teams who don\'t have much experience with web development or primarily want a basic site to showcase their project. Docusaurus already supports sites needing more advanced features like internationalization for Jest and versioning for React Native. As different projects request new features for their sites, they are added to Docusaurus and simultaneously provided to all projects! All together, this ends up greatly reducing the work needed to maintain different sites for different projects. Our teams are able to focus on keeping their projects healthier by spending more time adding features, fixing bugs, and writing documentation.\\n\\n## Getting Up and Running\\n\\n![](/img/slash-up-and-running.png)\\n\\nAt its core, we wanted sites running Docusaurus to be simple to use. With one [installation](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation.html) command and some simple [configuration](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/site-preparation.html), you can actually have a default running website.\\n\\nWhen you run `docusaurus-init`, you will see a structure similar to:\\n\\n```bash\\nroot-of-repo\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs-examples-from-docusaurus\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 doc1.md\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 doc2.md\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 doc3.md\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 example-doc4.md\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 example-doc5.md\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 website\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 blog-examples-from-docusaurus\\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 2016-03-11-blog-post.md\\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 2017-04-10-blog-post-two.md\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 core\\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Footer.js\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 node_modules\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 package.json\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 pages\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 sidebars.json\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 siteConfig.js\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 static\\n```\\n\\nWith the exception of node_modules and package.json, all the directories and files you see are where you customize and add content to your Docusaurus-based website. The docs folder is where you add your Markdown that represents your documentation; the blog folder is where you add your Markdown for your [blog posts](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/blog.html); `siteConfig.js` is where you make most of the [customizations](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/site-config.html) for your site; `sidebars.json` is where you maintain the layout and content of the [sidebar](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/navigation.html) for your documentation; the `pages` folder is where you add [custom](https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/custom-pages.html) pages for your site; the `static` folder is where all of your static assets go (e.g., CSS stylesheets and images); and the `core` folder is where you can customize core components of the site, in this case the footer.\\n\\n## How does Docusaurus work?\\n\\nDocusaurus is written primarily in JavaScript and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react), replacing Jekyll which we used in the old template. We use [Remarkable](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable) for our Markdown rendering and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for our code block syntax highlighting. The core of Docusaurus\' functionality is in the [lib directory](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Docusaurus/tree/master/lib) of the [Docusaurus repo](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/). The general structure looks like:\\n\\n```bash\\nroot-of-Docusaurus\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 lib\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 core\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 server\\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 generate.js\\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 server.js\\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...and more files\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 static\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 build-files.js\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 copy-examples.js\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 generate-feed.js\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 publish-gh-pages.js\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 rename-version.js\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 start-server.js\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 versions.js\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 write-translations.js\\n```\\n\\nThe key files here are build-files.js and start-server.js. There are many similarities between these two files: `build-files.js` is used to build the physical artifacts for serving by an external web server. `start-server.js` is used to run the Docusaurus server and locally test your site. Both go through the following general process to take all of the Markdown and configuration to create a runnable website:\\n\\n1. Process your website settings in `siteConfig.js`\\n1. Read the document metadata that exists in all the Markdown files in your docs directory.\\n1. Create a table of contents for your documents based upon the IDs extracted from the metadata.\\n1. Convert the Markdown to HTML, including doing link replacement.\\n1. These files will go in a build/docs directory of the compiled site, and any translated versions will go into a language specific folder within the build/docs folder.\\n1. Repeat 1-3 for blog posts.\\n1. The blog file will go in a build/blog directory of the compiled site.\\n1. Read the main.css file and concatenate any user-defined css into master css file that will be in the build/css directory of the compiled site.\\n1. Copy images into an build/img directory of the compiled site.\\n1. Take any custom pages that were added to the pages folder of the site and compile/copy those into the root build directory of the compiled site. Any translated versions will go into a language specific folder within build.\\n1. Create CNAME and sitemap.xml files and add those to build.\\n\\nNote that this process does not take into full account how translations or versioning works. The underlying details of those features will be saved for future blog posts.\\n\\nThe final structure of your compiled site will look similar to:\\n\\n```bash\\nbuild\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 website\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 CNAME\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 blog\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 css\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 en\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 help.html # custom page\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 img\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html # landing page\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 sitemap.xml\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 users.html # custom page\\n```\\n\\n## Community\\n\\n![](/img/docusaurus.svg)\\n\\nWe welcome your [contributions](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to Docusaurus, whether you want to use it for your own site, you want to [contribute](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the Docusaurus core or just have questions.
