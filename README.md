# Docusaurus

Docusaurus is a project for easily building, deploying, and maintaining open source project websites. __CI badges go here__

* **Simple to Start** Docusaurus is built to be easy to get up and running in as little time possible. We've built Docusaurus to handle the website build process so you can focus on your project.  
* **Localizable** Docusaurus ships with localization support via CrowdIn. Empower and grow your international community by translating your documentation.
* **Customizable** Docusaurus ships with the key pages and sections you need to get started. A home page, a docs section, a blog, and additional support pages.

## Installation

Docusaurus is available as `docusaurus` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
